    Deep funding combines two ideas:

    1. Value as a graph: instead of asking "how much did X contribute to humanity?", ask "how much of the credit for Y belongs to X?"
    2. Distilled human judgement: an open market of AIs fills in all the weights, human jury randomly spot-checks them

    https://x.com/TheDevanshMehta/status/1867600164502089925

    (1) has been a growing paradigm recently, for good reason. Contribution is hard to measure in the abstract: if you ask people how much they would pay to save N birds, they answer $80 for N=2000 and N=200000. "Local" questions like "is A or B more valuable to C?" are much more tractable.

    (2) is based on ideas in my info finance post: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/11/09/infofinance.html#info-finance-for-distilled-human-judgement . Anyone can use any methods (eg. AI) to suggest weights for *all* edges, a human jury does detailed analysis on a random subset. The submissions that are most compatible with the jury answers decide the final output.

    An important step.
    Some important next steps:
      * Helios (or alternatives) being integrated into user wallets, on mobile and desktop
      * L2 configs moving onchain (first step: https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/669 )
      * L2 configs including specification of state proof verification rules (a possible starting point: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668 )
    Once those three are done, we get universal L1 and L2 light client verification!

    I appreciate all the memecoins that donate portions of their supply directly to charity.

    (eg. I saw ebull sent a bunch to various groups last month)

    Anything that gets sent to me gets donated to charity too (thanks moodeng! The 10B from today is going to anti-airborne-disease tech), though I truly prefer if you guys send to charity directly, maybe even make a DAO and get your community directly engaged in the decisions and process.

    I've said before that I think the best thing for memecoins is if they can be maximally positive-sum for the world, so it's great to see moments when that actually happens!

    Some thoughts on solo staking, what realistic value solo (+ small-business and community) stakers could provide to the network, and what changes L1 can make to better support solo stakers.

  * Tweet:
    I take this seriously. Starting next year, I plan to only publicly mention (in blogs, talks, etc) L2s that are stage 1+, with *maybe a short grace period* for new genuinely interesting projects.

    It doesn't matter if I invested, or if you're my friend; stage 1 or bust.

    Multiple ZK-rollup teams have told me they're on track to be stage 1 by year end. I'm excited to see that happen!

    Of course we should not throw away training wheels become we're actually confident that the proof systems are secure; that would be irresponsible. But stage 1 (75% threshold on council to override the proof system, 26%+ of council must be outside the rollup team) is a very reasonable moderate milestone. The multisigs I'm in have not had a single liveness failure in years, let alone 26%.

    The era of rollups being glorified multisigs is coming to an end. The era of cryptographic trust is upon us.

    BTW the above also applies to L2 tokens or other project tokens I hold (incl not-yet-liquid): all proceeds will be donated, again either to support public goods within the ethereum ecosystem or broader charity (eg. biomedical R&D).

    I also do not intend to invest into L2s or other token projects in the foreseeable future. My goal with giving projects money is to support things that I think are valuable, especially in cases where other parts of the ecosystem might undervalue them. Going forward, I plan to just do this with donations.

    Airdrops are a fascinating initial use case for ZK / blockchain-based identity / credential / attestation frameworks. The goals of an airdrop are:

    (i) distribute to community members [and not randos who will all immediately sell]
    (ii) reward contributions to the project
    (iii) be reasonably egalitarian [but some disparity is ok]
    (iv) resist extractive/adversarial farming

    These are exactly the properties that identity / credential / attestation frameworks (eg. see ideas in https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/08/21/plurality.html#8_1 ) are trying to achieve. Hence, for anyone building such frameworks, it makes perfect sense to use token issuance as an initial use case to beta-test and refine their work in an adversarial environment.

  * Tweet:
    One related point is that giving tokens away for free is not the only "form factor" that makes sense for this: you can also do discounted sales.

    I talk about reasons why to do this here:

    https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/08/22/prices.html

    Depending on the degree of membership/contribution you can prove, you can buy a corresponding number of tokens at a reduced price. This helps make the supply more distributed and rewards non-financial contributors, while still ensuring buyers have "skin in the game".

    Any technique that works for airdrops also works for discounts. A related concept (CT 
    @pujaohlhaver
    
    @IdenaNetwork
    ) is to subsidize savings rates for smaller accounts as an alternative to UBI. Singapore's CPF already does something similar.

    Summary of Ethereum block-building research as of 2024-08-07:

    * Everyone agrees that having multiple actors contribute txs that must be included in the block is a good idea

    Epochs and slots all the way down: ways to give Ethereum users faster transaction confirmation times

# YouTube Video Transcripts of `Vitalik Buterin`:
  - Video: "Vitalik Buterin - What Excites Me About the Next Decade - TOKEN2049 Singapore 2024"
    A lot of the time when people talk about some of the challenges with crypto one of the answers that people tend to give is people tend to say you know this is still early days right we're still building we're still building out the basic infrastructure you know look how long something like the internet uh took to came into fruition right and this is something that I think people have been saying since uh like basically almost since Bitcoin itself launched and one of the challenges with saying this of course is that today you know we are not in early days anymore right Bitcoin has existed for 15 years ethereum as a project has existed for more than 10 years and uh you know we see things like Chad GPT rising up from not even existing as companies to suddenly completely changing everyone's understanding of what intelligence even is and so you have to ask the question of like well how do we actually even think about this right are we actually early and the way that I answer this question is I think we are not early to crypto but we are early to crypto actually being usable so let me explain what I mean with uh by going a little bit into history so who here remembers back in 2013 when we were all excited about Bitcoin and uh Bitcoin was the next big thing Bitcoin was the next big revolution for payments and people were making these really amazing and really Earnest efforts to try to just get regular Merchants all around the world to start accepting Bitcoin who here remembers room 77 in Berlin anyone here eight there yeah so the one on the right this is Boston it's a restaurant called thonus monkfish that's actually the first Bitcoin restaurant that I want to so back in 2013 you could be a proud Bitcoin accepted here restaurant and also be a proud LGBT Friendly restaurant at the same time and um you know crypto Twitter would not think that there is any contradiction uh so back at the time there was like real genuine excitement about this so what happened well one way to answer this is uh we can look a little bit further and uh the memory that comes to me is this to Argentina that I made in 2021 so this was my first time in Argentina and the first thing that I noticed was that there was this population Countrywide that was not just incredibly excited about crypto but that was actively using it on a massive scale like literally yeah I was walking around on Christmas Day and the first coffee shop that I noticed was open I walked in the owner knew who I was and the owner let me pay an e for the coffee and some dessert that I had with my friends now they were using crypto but they were not using decentralized technology what they what were they using it turns out the Argentinian locals were all using binance to binance transfers why binance to binance transfers are instant and binance to binance transfers are free and this is ultimately the same problem that I think ended up killing at least the original wave of exploration into getting everyone to adopt Bitcoin as a currency it was the fees if you remember the marketing at the very beginning why Bitcoin is great it talks a lot about how Western Union PayPal credit card companies they all just horribly you on fees they charge like incredibly High fees like they're awful right but then Bitcoin itself the fees went up to $50 um ethereum all the fees went up to the highest ever fee that I paid on uh ether was uh actually for a privacy preserving transaction so admittedly the gas went went up and uh you know basically like big parts of Twitter comment every time I do things so privacy protocols have a really good product Market fit and so the transaction feels about $800 so basically the reason why a lot of this stuff failed is fees what's new in 20124 well this is a chart of fees on ethereum lawyer 2s they have gone down from being somewhere between 10 and 50 cents to being under 1 cent basically zero at the same time optimism and arbitrum two major ethereum Lear ones have hit this important security Milestone that's called stage one and multiple rollups have also told me that they plan to head stage one very soon so rollups are rapidly becoming safer and rollups actually are finally affordable but this is not the only thing that's improved one of the other annoyances that I distinctly remember suffering on my trip to Argentina was uh I tried paying one of these people in eth on layer one the transaction fee was about $4 and the transaction took about 5 minutes to confirm now this was after EAP 1559 had come on chain but this particular wallet it had not actually upgraded to AP1 1559 yet so on bitcoin blocks come every 10 minutes and so you have to wait 10 minutes potentially an hour for transactions to confirm ethereum theoretically the block time is 13 seconds but because of the way that the gas market used to be really inefficient sometimes you'd have to wait a totally random amount if you get unlucky 5 minutes maybe even longer for a transaction to get included ep1 559 actually basically fixed this and if you add on the merge the one of the things that the merge did is it also cut in half the average waiting time until the next block and so with both of those those things actually these days I reliably have my own transactions confirmed in 5 to 15 seconds then if you use layer twos that have fast pre-confirmation often this gets down to 1 second and so basically the two big problems that are this the biggest things that made centralized ux much better than decentralized ux in 2021 today decentralized ux has them too but also we can look at the general us experience quality of applications so on the left here you have ether tweet from 2015 and you know it looked it clearly looks like a hackathon demo now on the right here you can look at Firefly which is a client for forecaster and Twitter and lens and if you look at the quality of the UI like this looks like a web 2 level of quality but it it's a decentralized application under the hood but also this year we saw progress in a account abstract we saw more and more people using safe we saw ZK email E 7702 we're starting to see mainstreaming in ZK sarks all kinds of different applications so we have new and better privacy protocols Railway Oxo uh zoo zoo pass which we'll talk about a bit later raro which can prove that in zero knowledge that you have a passport and then you could do voting on top of that also even existing ease of use improvements between ler 2s two years ago everyone was complaining about having to manually switch networks today I think like for a at least the last year I actually haven't yet manually had to switch networks so before the limitations of the technology were a stopping Factor like I even remember that moment where crypto kitties looked like it might become this really big breakout app but then what happened crypto Kitty own success pushed the ethereum gas price all the way up to 50 gay ethereum became basically unusable and that by itself put a ceiling on the grow this is nor true but this basically means that the reasons not to use crypto are nor here what about the reasons to come in the first place one of the uh mistakes that I think people sometimes make is uh talking about crypto as being an efficiency technology this is something that a lot of people talked about even back in 10 years ago so this is a random page from 2013 that was just listing the benefits of accepting Bitcoin right so P Made Easy um security and control over your money zero or L Fe or low fees protect your identity right so two of the four are I think things are feat that are features that are very unique to crypto the other two well they were unique to crypto then but are they now right today we have venmo we have a much better sea payments there's WeChat pay the centralized systems keep getting better and better but yet in some places payments and access to finance remain durably difficult why do they remain difficult it's not because of access to technology it's uh basically because of limit limitations in global politics so I think it's important to remember right that the kinds of benefits that crypto brings to the world they don't have to do with technological improvements of the same type as switching from a regular jet to a supersonic jet is a technological Improvement it's a type of Technology what kind of type so one way to look at this is uh this blog post that Josh Stark from the ethereum foundation wrote about two years ago and the title here is atoms institutions and blockchains and the thesis is that blockchains allow us to create a kind of digital hardness any kind of social hardness basically that lets us create persistent digital structures that are hard that and that can resist being broken in the same way that you can make hard physical structure out of something like concrete and if you think about how blockchains from some of the previous Cipher pug technologies that they came from things like mixnet things like tour things like bit torrent the thing that you realize is that blockchains are all about creating persistent structures that are extremely robust right so a file sharing Network well if a if your file share Network blows up that's fine you just switch to a different one and after a week everyone forgets if a blockchain blows up and you switch to a different one everyone loses all of their money this is a fundal difference between what technologies before blockchains did and what blockchains do and so blockchains because of this enable the internet to not just Route Around weaknesses in Old World structures but also do an actually better job of uh building better Alternatives that can solve similar kinds of problems so blockchains are digital concrete and digital concrete digital concrete for building digital Castles in the Sky so who here has uh seen this uh this movie a la Castle in the Sky raise your hand if you've seen it raise your hand if you know the opening theme song okay let's do a sing along so this is uh one of the actually so the reason why this movie is fun is I mean first of all I actually think it's like great and I think like studio gibl is absolutely top tier and you could probably tell I've seeing this like five times at least but um it turns out that it was like also somehow accidentally the inspiration for ethereum without us even me even realizing it basically what happened was in 2013 I was browsing a Wikipedia list of fictional elements right and I Came Upon ethereum in that list and in the list I saw okay this looks like a really nice name right and you know it reminds me of this 19th century scientific theory this idea that there's this medium that permeates everything and so okay fine I picked the name then two months later one of the ethereum foundation designers back before it was even called the ethereum foundation uh decided to use this diamond as the ethereum logo I thought okay this is a really cool diamond it's I like the logo it's beautiful years later I watched this movie for the first time and then I saw wait they have etherum crysteum cysts look diamonds and so it turns that a of eum like art was uh inspired by this without even realizing it so and the other thing about that like that song right is that the song like it actually sounds nice right like I think in crypto you know we actually need better songs right it's like you know a lot of the time if you ask someone to like come up with an Anthem for a project like they come up with something that's totally cringe right it's like decentralized We Stand United a hash confirmed a new block invited like okay you know if you like rap then that's good right but uh do you really want that to be your Anthem forever right okay so I mean you know back in 2013 right there was this other song that I remember there there it was uh there was this artist named krya it's Q said and done all your Fe inflate be on the Sun but no more because now there's a better one and its properties perform better than all the rest of them it's mathematical no more double spend it's encrypt put your cash in your brain or it's wearable a new form of wealth begins wait who here actually remembers that one okay I do uh so see it like digital Castles in the Sky I think are the unifying theme that combines the serious and the fun aspects of crypto together this is what I want people to remember a castle is something that can protect you and keep your family and keep your tribe safe a castle can also be a castle in Disneyland that lets your community have fun a castle can also be a museum that preserves all of the entire thousand year history of your culture and a digital Castle similarly can be all of these things and dig and digital castles of all types are something that we can build on on top of ethereum so done with digital castles um what should our key goal be so this is I know my view that I've said the whole time right we need to satisfy the needs of mainstream adoption and we need to hold on to open source and decentralization values at the same time what does this mean so example one W it's right there's two to hold your m one of those you Bally you know you do like the crazy self- sovereignty maximalist thing you write down a seed phrase you do everything offline you take your seed phrase you engrave it on a piece of titanium you put your titanium inside of a lock box that's made out of even more titanium and then you like put that lock box 10 me underground and then your coins are safe right so that's one approach the other approach is to say bro I'm like a normie I'm not going to do all that and so instead you basically go and you take your coins and you go off to give them to some trustworthy guy you know there's this nice guy his name is Sam he goes on panels with Bill Clinton he's got to be trustworthy and uh you know two years later it uh you know it turns out that your assessment of who's trustworthy and who's not was a little bit wrong so I think these are not the only two Alternatives right so basically if you want to be protected against centralized Bad actors then you do the traditional self- custody thing and if you really want you can put it in titanium and put it 10 met underground if you want to be protected from your own mistakes you do a centralized exchange what if you want both this is what smart wallets with multisig let you do multisig means you have multiple keys so you might have for example six keys out of which you need four to send a transaction and you could even have a rule that for small transactions you only need one and those keys can be any combination of keys that you can contrum friends and family ZK rappers of existing services so you could even make a yaik rapper of an email you can literally today make an ethereum account which is a smart contract wallet from which you can only send transactions if you generate a proof that you canoll a particular email address right so you can basically take web 2 uh trust anchors and you can like pull them into the web 3 world and in the web 3 world you can even diversify your trust right so you can ZK w a Gmail account which is a US company then you could combine that to make another one of your Guardians be a ZK rapper of uh you know like an Indian government ID and then you make a third key be a hardware wall wallet that was made by a company in China right like you can maximally diversify everything and so even you can actually get the benefits of institutional trust without a lot of the weaknesses so example 1.5 decentralized social media ux forecaster is a user experience wise warcast as a web2 quality app but you can set your recovery address the thing that has ultimate control over your account to be your multisig and I personally trust my multisig way more than any one of my centralized accounts example two payments so this is a doo it's a wallet that is meant to be entirely ethereum based but it has the same ux quality as venmo example three privacy pools privacy pools uses a mechanism where users can prove that their Depo their withdrawal came from some deposit without revealing which one but revealing that their deposit did not come from one of the bad guys and so this is a way that allows you to have a very high degree of privacy for regular users and meet a lot of uh important compliance needs but without actually having back doors example four ZK social media this is a zoo pole which uses zo pass and so can prove that you're a human prove that you're a member of a community solve proof of personhood problems solve reputation problems while still preserving your privacy it's not about either you're an Anon or no and nobody trusts you or you're KY didn't verify that you have no privacy it's like no you can have privacy and you can have trust at the same time example five ethereum layer one a lot of technological improvements that are happening that make the layer one both more performant in terms of red ring finality time increasing capacity and at the same time more decentralized and easy to verify and a lot of these things are already happening right so this like these are all directions that the ethereum ecosystem and I think crypto in general are going to be going over the next 10 years right we uh basically the two wrong paths are one is to sacrifice practicality for decentralization and forever being an ecosystem that's just appealing to itself and only has 691 users the other bad path is to sacrifice decentralization for practicality and to say okay well we're trying to get Mass adoption and so guess what the next great crypto application you have to log into it with a freaking Gmail account right what do we do best well no you know we do not have to take either of these dark choices we have decentralization and we have practicality at the same time eat both pills be purple take both thank you

    Thanks to the power of modern communication we have the ability to create technologies that are decentralized removing middlemen and allowing users to interact with each other directly through a global network decentralized applications have been becoming more and more important in the past 10 years and have the benefits of massively reducing costs and barriers to entry removing single points of failure preventing censorship and ensuring transparency and trust between all the parties involved in an interaction bittorrent a file sharing network that developed in the early 2000s is arguably the first decentralized application to have been created bitsword allows anyone to share any kind of file with anyone else in the world allowing people to distribute content quickly and easily even if they do not have the resources to pay for their own website or server five years later satoshi nakamoto came up with the idea of a blockchain a sort of distributed database and used it to build bitcoin the world's first decentralized currency decentralized currencies like bitcoin allow people to send money instantly anywhere around the world with no regard for national borders with negligible fees bitcoin is increasingly being used for international remittances micro payments and commerce online decentralized applications for finance cloud computing messaging and distributed governance are soon to come ethereum is a platform that is specifically designed for people to build these kinds of decentralized applications or dapps for short the ethereum client which we are calling the ether browser will include ability in peer-to-peer network for sending messages and a generalized blockchain with a built-in programming language allowing people to use the blockchain for any kind of decentralized application that they want to create ethereum can be used to build financial applications that are fully trustworthy and transparent because they run on the blockchain online cryptographically secure systems for managing your property and contracts social networking and messaging systems that allow users to maintain control of their own data systems for trading underutilized computational resources like CPU time and hard drive space and eventually tools for online voting and distributed governance and the most exciting applications of ethereum are probably the ones that we have not even thought of as with all new platforms for innovation like the protocols that underlie the internet itself it is not always easy to predict what they're going to be used for gmail facebook twitter instagram and the modern internet as a whole are all a result of early developments in the world wide web and javascript the programming language of the world wide web from the 1990s similarly by providing a universal programmable blockchain and packaging it up into a client that anyone can use the ethereum project hopes to do the same for finance peer-to-peer commerce distributed governance and human collaboration as a whole now the question is what will you build on top of ethereum.

  - Video: "Vitalik Buterin reveals Ethereum at Bitcoin Miami 2014"
    okay so back back when bitcoin was originally created in 2009 Satoshi zu was really testing two things at once so the first part is there's this idea of Bitcoin the decentralized currency it's a form of money that exists purely online and you could transfer it from anyone to anyone in the around the world instantly with pretty much no fees you can transfer money from Kyrgyzstan to Guatemala just as easily just as quickly and just as cheaply as you can to your own neighbor and there as we have seen there are a lot of people interested in that in that innovation Bitcoin form of money has attracted a pool of a ten billion dollars of wealth over the past five years it is being accepted by over 50 thousand merchants worldwide and there we have companies like Bitcoin coinbase that are injured that are trying very hard and I would say succeeding at getting Bitcoin adopted by increasingly large segments of the population and as a rymus said I think we're only getting started but at the same time there's also the other side of Bitcoin which is Bitcoin the blockchain so big Bitcoin the technology is this a global trust free peer decentralized database it's this database that anyone can add things to but no one could but you can't remove anything from and it just so own now it just so happens that currency is this is the first app now these two technologies by necessity have to be married together because in order to have the decentralized database you need to have security in order to have security you need to have incentives and you need to have a currency so so really Satoshi had to take these two concepts which are really quite different and test them both at the same time now this the second side of Bitcoin the Bitcoin blockchain is something that I think has been seeing a bit less attention maybe in the first few years but interest is also picking up so here are some of the first applications of Bitcoin not as a form of money but Bitcoin as a form of distributed consensus so first one is same coin name coin is essentially a distributed DNS system for those who do not know what a DNS system is when you go to google.com how does your computer know which server to talk to so the answer is that there exists this the system which Maps Google the name google.com to the server's IP address so your computer actually first queries this domain name system and it asks hey what server is google.com and the sir and the server answers and that's and that's how your you're able to talk to talk to Google server without having to memorize everyone's IP address second second part escort transactions so we a lot of people here I'm sure I've heard of the concept of multi set of multi-sig so the idea here is that you send money to say three people at once in such a way that you need two of those people to unlock the funds so what are some practical applications of that one practical application might be say consumer protection so for example if you want if I'm a merchant and I'm selling some product to you the consumer the simplest way to do that for it would be for you to just pay me and for me to send the product but what if you don't know me and I'm not necessarily trustworthy so then what you would do is we would both agree on an arbitrator and we would and you would send the money to our two of three multi-sig between yourself myself and the arbitrator I would send the product and then at some point normally you would confirm that you receive the product and the two of us together would release the funds now if one of us disappears or one of us turns out to be dishonest then the arbitrator can step can step in and work with the other person to recover the funds so this is essentially bitcoins also alternative to PayPal chargeback system now then we have this concept of colored coins colored coin the idea behind colored coins I would say saw its first beginnings in 2012 so the idea there is okay you have a blockchain and you have a currency on it but what if you can put other currencies on the blockchain as well so the idea there is this is to say I let's suppose that I am a goal sure I might be countable ammaji metals or some larger company and I and I wants to issue gold on the blockchain so what would I do I would take say ten bitcoins and I would and I would say each one of these bitcoins is also worth 10 ounces of gold and I would say it's each one and that's each one of these specific bitcoins and then you could actually track those specific bitcoins through the blockchain and you can treat them as sort of their own currency living and living inside the Bitcoin system and then if someone at some future point in time returns one of these colored gold coins to me then I will return to them in ten ounces of gold now then so now you have the system where you have lots of different currencies on the Bitcoin blockchain what's the next step well let's have a decentralized exchange between the currencies so as it turns out that this is this is actually somewhat hard to implement so it has to so the research behind it has actually taken some time to develop and we are actually seeing a lot of interesting protocols around that over the last six months now after that there's also some other interesting ideas there's this concept of smart property so the idea there might be what it what if you had or say a museum pass and in the idea there is that you would issue a currency was just where that currency has one unit and if you own that unit then you can use you can use your phone and you can and you can sign a message with the private with the private key that owns that that would old currency token and then that sort of works that works as a museum pass you can use it to get into a museum if you want to if you want to sell the museum pass then you just transfer the coin to someone else and now and now they can sign it with their phone they can get and they can gain access another idea is smart contracts so the idea there is that instead of having contracts that are in four that are enforced by the legal system you have contracts that in section we enforce themselves so one idea here might be a financial contract so suppose that I might want to put one a thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin into this financial contract and then someone some other counterparty would put $1,000 into the financial contract and then what one month later I would get $1,000 worth of Bitcoin back and the idea is what if you can have this contract in force itself so in that in that way I can essentially have a thousand dollars worth of value without without volatility risk on the on the blockchain without having to rely on it on any kind of centralized issuer finally there's this idea of decentralized autonomous organizations so the idea of a Dao or as other terms you might have heard include decentralized autonomous corporations or decentralized autonomous companies decentralized autonomous communities India there is to have either a company an organization perhaps could be a company it could be something like WikiLeaks it could be something like ICANN the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and numbers that sort of which is the organization that actually manages the game IP address allocation and DNS registration and so forth what if you could have these organizations live entirely on the cloud so these organizations would still control resources but those resources would be controlled by us by a smart contract that never expires it just keeps on updating itself so unformed so these are essentially some of the applications and there are thousands more than we haven't even thought of now here's just a some detail about how colored coins works so you would have some issuers acquires that that's some subset of bitcoins have have a certain color and then if you send if you send a transaction where the inputs have a certain color then the outputs have the same color now if the inputs have mixed colors then you might have some special rules applying and then you would just trace the transactions back through the Bitcoin blockchain to determine what color they are so you can see there a simple diagram is that you might have color you might have green coins blue coins and red coins perhaps representing US Dollars gold stocks in a company whatever else and you could simply trace them through the transaction graph and figure and figure out exactly who owns the coins of each color at any given time now another more advanced idea is this concept of a metal coin so the idea behind a metal coin is this is this idea that we should treat metic owns as view which would treat Bitcoin as this low-level protocol like a sort of tcp/ip on the internet and then we should build other protocols on top so this other protocol would use Bitcoin just as a data layer it would put data into the Bitcoin ran into Bitcoin transactions and then you could see there would be a completely separate matter coin protocol that would scan through the transaction to determine what the balances are so what are the advantages pretty theoretically pretty much no limits you could have decentralized exchange you could have savings accounts you could have advanced smart contracts you could have peer to peer Satoshi dice theoretically there's pretty much no limits to what can be done with this kind of paradigm however the problem problem is that there have been there are a lot of we a lot of people think that you can that you can just implement all this stuff on top of Bitcoin but in reality there are actually serious we serious scalability issues to doing so and as I'll explain these scalability issues are actually the reason why people have been so people have been so frustrated trying to implement this stuff a colored coins project has been worked working hard for the pet for the last 18 months and they've been trying to come up with extremely clever color transfer rules and to try and make things more efficient but so the fundamental issue here is this concept of simplified payment verification so in Bitcoin as it turns out you do not need to download the entire blockchain to have a secure of a coin client you can just look for specific transactions and now Bitcoin has this mechanism called a Merkel tree that you can use where you can prove that a certain transaction exists in the Bitcoin blockchain but only download a small part of the data you of the entire data set so the idea there is that you can't Act is that nobody can actually Forge any part of the Merkel tree because the different the differences sort of keep on cascading upwards and eventually there's some kind of inconsistency problem is however if you do if you try now with Bitcoin simplified payment verification is nice and easy lots of when clients use it it's great with colored coins it's actually hard because you have to trace every single transact every single transaction back all the way back through the back through the blockchain and I couldn't you have you might need to do hundreds or thousands of simple high payment verification requests with meta coins it's pretty much impossible every node has to process everything so here is where aetherium comes in so if your so what we've said with the theorem is that yes this idea that we should have HTTP on top of tcp/ip is wonderful that's the way the internet protocol works that's the way every other protocol works that's the way cryptocurrency protocols should work but bitcoin fundamentally was never designed to be a TC a tcp/ip bitcoin was more designs to be an SMTP smtp being the protocol for email it's a protocol that is that is very good at one particular test Bitcoin is very good is very good for transferring money but it was not designed as a foundational layer for other for any kind of protocols to be built on top so aetherium is there for its own blockchain so a theory borrows from ripple this concept that we should separate the state from the transaction list so you do not need to download every single every single transaction that ever happens in order to determine what the current state is and here is the fundamental part it has its own built-in programming language so the idea there is that if you look at a lot of the recent innovation in some of these so-called next-generation coins what someone's I've been saying is okay we want people want people to be able to do the centralized exchange on the blockchain here's a transaction st√©phanie centralized exchange we want people to be able to do a peer-to-peer gambling there's a transaction type for that we want people to be able to have savings wallets or the transaction type for that we want people to be able to do escrow there's a transaction type for that so that is that is fundamentally if the wrong way to go about doing things just imagine if your computer actually had 30 Hardware modules you would it would have a hardware module for solitaire a hardware module for internet enter explore a hardware module for chrome hardware module for a for Photoshop that's what that's not the way we do things you know back in 1933 in the 1930s Alan - Alan Turing came up came up with this this concept of Turing complete programming languages where instead of having instead of specializing for each individual application you come up with a programming language and then that programming language is so powerful that you can build any application on top that can conceivably be built this is the reason why computers are so powerful today this is the reason why web browsers are so powerful today once we after we came out with JavaScript around around 2000 you know the internet just blew up the inventors of java scripts never intended for somebody to write gmail on top of javascript or for somebody to write facebook on top of JavaScript or for somebody to write Bitcoin wallets on top of JavaScript but javascript this programming language of the internet browser was a foundation for innovation and that's why 13 years later we are still innovating today and that's what I hope to bring to the world of cryptocurrency so what is a contract so aetherium instead of having lots of features tries to be simple it says if you really we do not have features we have just the programming language so everything that you want to implement through aetherium you would have to implement as a contract so a contract is like this automated agents that lives inside the blockchain and it has a certain amount of and it has some script scripting code built in and it can store it can store ether it can sting can store currents it can store currency units and you activate a contract by sending a transaction to it so the idea is that you can send money into contracts and you can send messages to messages to cut to contracts in order to make to make them carry out certain computations order or perhaps to authorize withdrawals or it's in order to make votes in a decentralized organization or even to make sure answers in an internal currency so out of this one built out of this one building block this is this one single leg of LEGO brick of cryptocurrency you can make pretty much anything soap etherium script is the language this is the current scripting language that we that we have is a language it's somewhat similar to Bitcoin script but it's also more powerful so we have a stack we have some operations we have but the differences with Bitcoin is that we have memory entries and also we have this concept of storage so BIC won't this is the other fundamental limitation of Bitcoin scripting language the kwid scripting language is binary a transaction is either spent or it's not spent that is fundamentally extremely limiting because you cannot have if you look at something like a decentralized organization or a financial contract of any kind of complexity you cannot reduce it to this concept of SS expires it's not expired so here we have contracts can have pretty much an unlimited number of number of states so you could have a contract to be at stage 1 at stage 2 at stage 3 you could have a contract store an entire write an entire balance sheet so right so now how about we'll talk about a few examples of what you can do with the theorem that perhaps might be difficult to do with Bitcoin first of all named coin so here is named coin in five lines of code so what is a so this named coin this is a 60 million dollar million dollar cryptocurrency you can implement the most basic version of name point in five lines of code so this is the contract so the idea here is that for is basically it's using contract storage so the contract look so a transaction it needs to have two data inputs the first data input is what name you want to register and the sec and the second one is what you want to register it with so that second one thing might be an address it might be some kind of might be a public key so then if some if it's already registered then you do nothing although other otherwise you register it and that's all it is so here's another interest the other interesting thing about aetherium is that we can work together with protocols that are not just financial so for example in there's the state there's this idea of bit message bit messages as purely peer-to-peer over open source decentralized replacement for email but one of the huge problems with big messages is usability aspect because in email you could send to some to some nice and easy email like Vitalik and etherial at aetherium zorg now here in a bit message there's no there are no email addresses there are these long 34 character bit message addresses nobody's going to remember a bit message address people don't even want to want to bid message addresses what if you could register a bit message address inside of this namecoin contract with something nice and simple like if it's allocated theorems org and then if somebody wants to send money to me there dear whoa it can just look up my they can enter vitalik at etherium org and their clients can just look up my actual bit message address inside of this namecoin contract create your own currency now creating now a lot of people are saying like we have way too many currencies now why do we have so why do we have so many currencies now I actually think this might this is extremely powerful in a way that not many people realize here's here's the deal in the in the past ten thousand years one of one of the major political dynamics has been this concept of centralization and decentralization we all understand the benefits of the central of decentralized system we all understand the idea the idea of localized markets of individuals acting independently but at the same but at the same time we understand that centralization has it has its benefits like there is and that one particular benefit there is this concept of public goods so there are a lot of things like science like scientific research like prevent like protecting the environment like fighting disease all these applications that are extremely valuable but they're but their value is so is extremely widely distributed so that each individual would only benefit an insect an insignificant amount from each from each particular action Mart pure markets have have no way of paying for this centralized and centralized institutions do simply because they are so large that they can act that they can absorb enough of the benefit for it to be worth it for them for them to do these things so this is why we have large corporations this is why we you this is why we often we have large governments and this is why we have large Don prophets now currencies are actually as a very interesting thing because creating your own current currency is actually Lee for the first time that we have something which is simultaneously decentralized and it can find these public goods you can have a currency such that twenty per say twenty percent of the issuance goes to P goes to people who do mathematical research and then if people want to support mathematical research they can accept the currency that's no caught that doesn't actually cost to them it's not like they're donating they're not losing money but at the same time the more merch the more merchants X the more people accept this currency the currency just naturally gained naturally gains value and people work people working on these on math problems just yet this this extra phantom value out of nowhere you could have currency is funded if that finds medical research you could have you could have currencies that are that try to find environmental applications so the idea here is that one let's not have one currency let's let's have thousands of currencies and we can have this form of this sort of economic democracy through a currency system so aetherium is a platform that makes that makes it a thousand times easier to bootstrap your own decentralized currency because you can just make it as a contract hedging contracts we talked about this a bit I put in one thousand dollars you put in one thousand dollars worth of worth of cryptocurrencies or worth of Bitcoin worth of ether and then a month later I get a thousand dollars back and you get the rest so what's the value proposition for you get this bet you get to speculate in favor of if they're added to X leverage and the value proposition for me is I get secured I get security I don't have to deal with volatility risk so this so we've seen for a lot of applications that are trying to say oh let's help if people want to have US dollars on the blockchain what's having let's have an issuer and that issuer will issue their own currency in that currency can be redeemed for US dollars yes that is one way of doing it but you have to trust an issuer so here's another way of doing it you would you would have a contract that listens to a bloomberg price feed of what the you what the value of ether in u.s. dollars is and then it automatically gives me back a constant value you know a constant value of ether aetherium is internal currency but a constant constant value measured in US dollars so here this is not trust free but this is massively reduced trust because instead of trusting an issuer all you have to trust as a price feed and you can trust like nine out of nine hundred eighteen price feeds if you wants you can do for voting forwards you can do proof of proof of stake voting there are lots of ways that you can mitigate any kind of problems here decentralized autonomous organizations so what if you could have a company who will whose organizational bylaws instead of being enforced in the legal system are enforced literally on the blockchain so the organization might have some capital it might have a millions all words were a million dollars worth of ether but then you would or might even have a million the organ is a this contract might even have a million a million dollars stuck in a in a in a hedging contract so this is the other nice thing about aetherium contracts can use contracts so the idea here is that you will need two-thirds of an organization's member members in order to agree to do anything and that's pretty much the only rule you could even have self-modifying code you could have a rule that says you need you need the support of two-thirds of an organization's members in order to change the rules of the organization sure and some right just know more and more here some other interesting applications savings wallets so we talked about multi signature escrow here are some the etherium potentially offers them massively expanded versions of multisig a score could you withdraw limits crop insurance what is crop insurance you could have a hedging khanjan you could have a financial contract off of the weather peer-to-peer gambling so you can do a peer-to-peer Satoshi dice on the blockchain decentralized exchange data storage decentralized Dropbox you can you can have a decentralized Dropbox implementation that lets anyone participate you will be able to earn money by renting out your hard drive mesh networking computation systems you can use big-big you can expand this idea of name point and turn it into an entire reputation system into a decentralized so into an entire decentralized social network and perhaps maybe even Skynet yes where will the okay so I'll repeat it okay so I'll talk a bit about the about the funding model so we will have a fundraiser for two months starting fabric starting February 1st it will be available at funds etherium org so will be so the idea is that part of the initial issuance will be one thousand for one Bitcoin or up to two thousand ether for one Bitcoin if you get in or way to compensate for the increased risk so the issuance model is that we will fund rate suppose that we hand out X ether through the fundraiser then then there will be about zero point about 0.5 X will be pre mind and then 0.4 X after that will be minds per year forever so it's this hybrid of master core of the master granion triple model and the pure bit the pure Bitcoin mining model and even to a slight extent the info the inflationary model so the answer is in terms of in terms of the portion of the pre mind that has already been allocated that is vested for one year so if any of the if any of the founders though we've leave the project then within the within one year then then or if and then the other founders have the right have the right during the first year to cancel the to cancel their allocation in which case that will simply be this redistributed handed back through the etherium organization as a long-term reserve and then did you on the site one of the second part right so right so the big so at the start the Bitcoin is going is going to be centrally managed we will have will have a transparent accounting system so the big one will go towards development it will go toward heavy security research go toward developing applications toward working with broad projects like bit message and store developing things like things like incubators so we will have models and we all release cell very detailed documents on how we're going to do that over the next few days and eventually we hope to turn the etherium organization itself into a Dao okay I um hold on yeah um I will I will be just uh standing over there outside so if anyone wants to ask questions feel free

# Blogs and Articles of `Vitalik Buterin`:
  - Blog Tittle: "d/acc: one year later"
    Special thanks to Liraz Siri, Janine Leger and Balvi volunteers for feedback and review

    About a year ago, I wrote an article on techno-optimism, describing my general enthusiasm for technology and the massive benefits that it can bring, as well as my caution around a few specific concerns, largely centered around superintelligent AI, and the risk that it may bring about either doom, or irreversible human disempowerment, if the technology is built in the wrong ways. One of the core ideas in my post was the philosophy of : decentralized and democratic, differential defensive acceleration. Accelerate technology, but differentially focus on technologies improve our ability to defend, rather than our ability to cause harm, and in technologies that distribute power rather than concentrating it in the hands of a singular elite that decides what is true, false, good or evil on behalf of everyone. Defense like in democratic Switzerland and historically quasi-anarchist Zomia, not like the lords and castles of medieval feudalism.

    In the year since then, the philosophy and ideas have matured significantly. I talked about the ideas on 80,000 Hours, and have seen many responses, largely positive and some critical. The work itself is continuing and bearing fruit: we're seeing progress in verifiable open-source vaccines, growing recognition of the value of healthy indoor air, Community Notes continuing to shine, a breakout year for prediction markets as an info tool, ZK-SNARKs in government ID and social media (and securing Ethereum wallets through account abstraction), open-source imaging tools with applications in medicine and BCI, and more. In the fall, we had the first significant d/acc event: "d/acc Discovery Day" (d/aDDy) at Devcon, which featured a full day of speakers from all pillars of d/acc (bio, physical, cyber, info defense, plus neurotech). People who have been working on these technologies for years are increasingly aware of each other's work, and people outside are increasingly aware of the larger story: the same kinds of values that motivated Ethereum and crypto can be applied to the wider world.

    The future What d/acc is and is not It's the year 2042. You're seeing reports in the media about a new pandemic potentially in your city. You're used to these: people get over-excited about every animal disease mutation, and most of them come to nothing. The previous two actual potential pandemics were detected very early through wastewater monitoring and open-source analysis of social media, and stopped completely in their tracks. But this time, prediction markets are showing a 60% chance of at least 10,000 cases, so you're more worried.

    The sequence for the virus was identified yesterday. Software updates for your pocket air tester to allow it to detect the new virus (from a single breath, or from 15 minutes of exposure to indoor air in a room) are available already. Open-source instructions and code for generating a vaccine using equipment that can be found in any modern medical facility worldwide should be available within weeks. Most people are not yet taking any action at all, relying mostly on widespread adoption of air filtering and ventilation to protect them. You have an immune condition so you're more cautious: your open-source locally-running personal assistant AI, which handles among other tasks navigation and restaurant and event recommendation, is also taking into account real-time air tester and CO2 data to only recommend the safest venues. The data is provided by many thousands of participants and devices using ZK-SNARKs and differential privacy to minimize the risk that the data can be leaked or abused for any other purpose (if you want to contribute data to these datasets, there's other personal assistant AIs that verify formal proofs that these cryptographic gadgets actually work).

    Two months later, the pandemic disappeared: it seems like 60% of people following the basic protocol of putting on a mask if the air tester beeps and shows the virus present, and staying home if they test positive personally, was enough to push the transmission rate, already heavily reduced due to passive heavy air filtering, to below 1. A disease that simulations show might have been five times worse than Covid twenty years ago turns out to be a non-issue today.
    	
    Devcon d/acc day

    One of the most positive takeaways from the d/acc event at Devcon was the extent to which the d/acc umbrella successfully brought people together from very different fields, and got them to actually be interested in each other's work.

    Creating events with "diversity" is easy, but making different people with different backgrounds and interests actually relate to each other is hard. I still have memories of being forced to watch long operas in middle school and high school, and personally finding them boring. I knew that I was "supposed to" appreciate them, because if I did not then I would be an uncultured computer science slob, but I did not connect with the content on a more genuine level. d/acc day did not feel like that at all: it felt like people actually enjoyed learning about very different kinds of work in different fields.

    If we want to create a brighter alternative to domination, deceleration and doom, we need this kind of broad coalition building. d/acc seemed to be actually succeeding at it, and that alone shows the value of the idea.

    The core idea of d/acc is simple: decentralized and democratic differential defensive acceleration. Build technologies that shift the offense/defense balance toward defense, and do so in a way that does not rely on handing over more power to centralized authorities. There is an inherent tie between these two sides: any kind of decentralized, democratic or liberal political structure thrives best when defense is easy, and suffers the most challenge when defense is hard - in those cases, the far more likely outcome is some period of war of all against all, and eventually an equilibrium of rule by the strongest.

    The core principle of d/acc extends across many domains:

    Chart from My Techno-Optimism, last year
    One way to understand the importance of trying to be decentralized, defensive and acceleration-minded at the same time, is to contrast it with the philosophy that you get when you give up each of the three.
    Decentralized acceleration, but don't care about the "differential defensive" part. Basically, be an e/acc, but decentralized. There are plenty of people who take this approach, some who label themselves d/acc but helpfully describe their focus as "OFFENSE", but also plenty of others who are excited about "decentralized AI" and similar topics in a more moderate way, but in my view put insufficient attention on the "defensive" aspect.
    In my view, this approach may avoid the risk of global human dictatorship by the specific tribe you're worried about, but it doesn't have an answer to the underlying structural problem: in an offense-favoring environment, there's constant ongoing risk of either catastrophe, or someone positioning themselves as a protector and permanently establishing themselves at the top. In the specific case of AI, it also doesn't have a good answer to the risk of humans as a whole being disempowered compared to AIs.

    Differential defensive acceleration, but don't care about "decentralized and democratic". Embracing centralized control for the sake of safety has permanent appeal to a subset of people, and readers are undoubtedly already familiar with many examples, and the downsides of them. Recently, some have worried that extreme centralized control is the only solution to the extremes of future technologies: see this hypothetical scenario where "Everybody is fitted with a ‚Äòfreedom tag' ‚Äì a sequent to the more limited wearable surveillance devices familiar today, such as the ankle tag used in several countries as a prison alternative ... encrypted video and audio is continuously uploaded and machine-interpreted in real time". However, centralized control is a spectrum. One milder version of centralized control that's usually overlooked, but is still harmful, is resistance to public scrutiny in biotech (eg. food, vaccines), and the closed source norms that allow this resistance to go unchallenged.

    The risk of this approach is, of course, that the center is often itself the source of risk. We saw this in Covid, where gain-of-function research funded by multiple major world governments may have been the source of the pandemic, centralized epistemology led to the WHO not acknowledging for years that Covid is airborne, and coercive social distancing and vaccine mandates led to political backlash that may reverberate for decades. A similar situation may well happen around any risks to do with AI, or other risky technologies. A decentralized approach would better address risks from the center itself.

    Decentralized defense, but don't care about acceleration - basically, attempting to slow down technological progress, or economic degrowth.

    The challenge with this strategy is twofold. First, on balance technology and economic growth have been massively good for humanity, and any delay to it imposes costs that are hard to overstate. Second, in a non-totalitarian world, not advancing is unstable: whoever "cheats" the most and finds plausibly-deniable ways to advance anyway will get ahead. Decelerationist strategies can work to some extent in some contexts: European food being healthier than American food is one example, the success of nuclear non-proliferation so far is another. But they cannot work forever.

    With d/acc, we want to: Be principled at a time when much of the world is becoming tribal, and not just build whatever - rather, we want to build specific things that make the world safer and better. Acknowledge that exponential technological progress means that the world is going to get very very weird, and that humanity's total "footprint" on the universe will only increase. Our ability to keep vulnerable animals, plants and people out of harm's way must improve, but the only way out is forward. Build technology that keeps us safe without assuming that "the good guys (or good AIs) are in charge". We do this by building tools that are naturally more effective when used to build and to protect than when used to destroy. Another way to think about d/acc is to go back to a frame from the Pirate Party movements in Europe in the late 00s: empowerment.

    The goal is to build a world where we preserve human agency, achieving both the negative freedom of avoiding active interference (whether from other people acting as private citizens, or from governments, or from superintelligent bots) with our ability to shape our own destinies, and the positive freedom of ensuring that we have the knowledge and resources to. This echoes a centuries-long classical liberal tradition, which also includes Stewart Brand's focus on "access to tools" and John Stuart Mill's emphasis on education alongside liberty as key components of human progress - and perhaps, one might add, Buckminster Fuller's desire to see the process of global solving be participatory and widely distributed. We can see d/acc as a way of achieving these same goals given the technological landscape of the 21À¢·µó century.


    The third dimension: survive and thrive
    In my post last year, d/acc specifically focused on the defensive technologies: physical defense, bio defense, cyber defense and info defense. However, decentralized defense is not enough to make the world great: you also need a forward-thinking positive vision for what humanity can use its newfound decentralization and safety to accomplish.

    Last year's post did contain a positive vision, in two places:
    Focusing on the challenges of superintelligence, I proposed a path (far from original to me) of how we can have superintelligence without disempowerment: Today, build AI-as-tools rather than AI-as-highly-autonomous-agents Tomorrow use tools like virtual reality, myoelectrics and brain-computer interfaces to create tighter and tighter feedback between AI and humans Over time proceed toward an eventual endgame where the superintelligence is a tightly coupled combination of machines and us. When talking about info-defense, I also tangentially mentioned that in addition to _defensiv_e social technology that tries to help communities maintain cohesion and have high-quality discourse in the face of attackers, there is also progressive social technology that can help communities more readily make high-quality judgements: pol.is is one example, and prediction markets are another. But these two points felt disconnected from the d/acc argument: "here are some ideas for creating a more democratic and defense-favoring world at the base layer, and by the way here are some unrelated ideas for how we might do superintelligence".

    However, I think in reality there are some very important connections between what labelled above as "defensive" and "progressive" d/acc technology. Let's expand the d/acc chart from last year's post, by adding this axis (also, let's relabel it "survive vs thrive") to the chart and seeing what comes out:

    There is a consistent pattern, across all domains, that the science, ideas and tools that can help us "survive" in one domain are closely related to the science, ideas and tools that can help us "thrive". Some examples:
    A lot of recent anti-Covid research focuses on the role of viral persistence in the body as a mechanism for why Long Covid is such a problem. Recently, there are also signs that viral persistence may be responsible for Alzheimer's disease - if true, this implies that addressing viral persistence across all tissue types may be key to solving aging. Low-cost and miniature imaging tools such as those being built by Openwater can be powerful for treating microclots, or viral persistence, cancers, and they can also be used for BCI. Very similar ideas motivate the construction of social tools built for highly adversarial environments, such as Community Notes, and social tools built for reasonably cooperative environments, such as pol.is. Prediction markets are valuable in both high-cooperation and high-adversity environments. Zero knowledge proofs and similar technologies for doing computation on data while preserving privacy both increase the data available for useful work such as science, and increase privacy. Solar power and batteries are great for supercharging the next wave of clean economic growth, but they are also amazing for decentralization and physical resilience. In addition to this, there are also important cross-dependencies between subject areas:

    BCI is very relevant as an info-defense and collaboration technology, because it could enable much more detailed communication of our thoughts and intentions. BCI is not just bot-to-consciousness: it can also be consciousness-to-bot-to-consciousness. This echoes Plurality ideas about the value of BCI. A lot of biotech depends on info-sharing, and in many contexts people will only be comfortable sharing info if they are confident that it will be used for one application and one application only. This depends on privacy technology (eg. ZKP, FHE, obfuscation...) Collaboration technology can be used to coordinate funding for any of the other technology areas

    The hard question: AI safety, short timelines and regulation

    Different people have very different AI timelines. Chart from Zuzalu in Montenegro, 2023.

    The argument against my post last year that I found most compelling was a critique from the AI safety community. The argument goes: "sure, if we have half a century until we get strong AI, we can concentrate our energies and build all of these good things. But actually it's looking likely we have three year timelines until AGI, and another three years until superintelligence. And so if we don't want the world to be destroyed or otherwise fall into an irreversible trap, we can't just accelerate the good, we also have to slow down the bad, and this means passing powerful regulations that may make powerful people upset". In my post last year, I did indeed not call for any specific strategy to "slow down the bad", beyond vague appeals to not build risky forms of superintelligence. And so here, it's worth addressing the question directly: if we are living in the least convenient world, where AI risk is high and timelines are potentially five years away, what regulation would I support?

    First, the case for caution around new regulations Last year, the main proposed AI regulation was the SB-1047 bill in California. SB-1047 required developers of the most powerful models (those that take over $100M to train, or over $10M in the case of fine-tunes) to take some safety-testing measures before releasing. In addition, it imposed liability on developers of AI models if they take insufficient care. Many detractors argued that the bill was "a threat to open source"; I disagreed, because the cost thresholds meant that it affected only the most powerful models: even LLama3 was probably under the threshold. Looking back, however, I think there was a larger issue with the bill: like most regulation, it was overfitted to the present-day situation. The focus on training cost is proving fragile in the face of new technology already: the recent state-of-the-art quality Deepseek v3 model was trained at a cost of only $6 million, and in new models like o1 costs are shifting from training to inference more generally.

    Second, the most likely actors who would actually be responsible for an AI superintelligence doom scenario are realistically militaries. As we have seen in the last half-century of biosecurity (and beyond), militaries are willing to do scary things, and they can easily make mistakes. AI military use is advancing rapidly today (see Ukraine, Gaza). And any safety regulation that a government passes, by default would exempt their own military, and corporations that cooperate closely with the military.

    That said, these arguments are not reasons to throw up our hands and do nothing. Rather, we can use them as a guide, and try to come up with rules that would trigger these concerns the least.

    Strategy 1: Liability
    If someone acts in some way that causes legally actionable damage, they could be sued. This does not solve the problem of risks from militaries and other "above-the-law" actors, but it is a very general-purpose approach that avoids overfit, and is often supported by libertarian-leaning economists for this exact reason.

    The primary targets for liability that have been considered so far are:
    Users - the people who use the AI
    Deployers - intermediaries who offer AI as a service for users
    Developers - the people who build the AI
    Putting liability on users feels most incentive-compatible. While the link between how a model is developed and how it ends up being used is often unclear, the user decides exactly how the AI is used. Liability on users creates a strong pressure to do AI in what I consider the right way: focus on building mecha suits for the human mind, not on creating new forms of self-sustaining intelligent life. The former responds regularly to user intent, and so would not cause catastrophic actions unless the user wanted them to. The latter would have the greatest risk of going off and creating a classic "AI going rogue" scenario. Another benefit of putting liability as close to end usage as possible is that it minimizes the risk that liability will lead to people taking actions that are harmful in other ways (eg. closed source, KYC and surveillance, state/business collusion to clandestinely restrict users as with eg. debanking, locking out large regions of the world).

    There is a classic argument against putting liability solely on users: users may be regular individuals without too much money, or even anonymous, leaving no one that could actually pay for a catastrophic harm. This argument can be overstated: even if some users are too small to be held liable, the average customer of an AI developer is not, and so AI developers would still be incentivized to build products that can give their users assurance that they won't face high liability risk. That said, it is still a valid argument, and needs to be addressed. You need to incentivize someone in the pipeline who has the resources to take the appropriate level of care to do so, and deployers and developers are both easily available targets who still have a lot of influence over how safe or unsafe a model is.

    Deployer liability seems reasonable. A commonly cited concern is that it would not work for open-source models, but this seems manageable, especially since there is a high chance that the most powerful models will be closed source anyway (and if they turn out to be open, then while deployer liability does not end up very useful, it also does not cause much harm). Developer liability has the same concern (though with open source models there is some speed-bump of needing to fine-tune a model to cause it to do some originally disallowed thing), but the same counterargument applies. As a general principle, putting a "tax" on control, and essentially saying "you can build things you don't control, or you can build things you do control, but if you build things you do control, then 20% of the control has to be used for our purposes", seems like a reasonable position for legal systems to have.

    One idea that seems under-explored is putting liability on other actors in the pipeline, who are more guaranteed to be well-resourced. One idea that is very d/acc friendly is to put liability on owners or operators of any equipment that an AI takes over (eg. by hacking) in the process of executing some catastrophically harmful action. This would create a very broad incentive to do the hard work to make the world's (especially computing and bio) infrastructure as secure as possible.

    Strategy 2: Global "soft pause" button on industrial-scale hardware
    If I was convinced that we need something more "muscular" than liability rules, this is what I would go for. The goal would be to have the capability to reduce worldwide available compute by ~90-99% for 1-2 years at a critical period, to buy more time for humanity to prepare. The value of 1-2 years should not be overstated: a year of "wartime mode" can easily be worth a hundred years of work under conditions of complacency. Ways to implement a "pause" have been explored, including concrete proposals like requiring registration and verifying location of hardware.

    A more advanced approach is to use clever cryptographic trickery: for example, industrial-scale (but not consumer) AI hardware that gets produced could be equipped with a trusted hardware chip that only allows it to continue running if it gets 3/3 signatures once a week from major international bodies, including at least one non-military-affiliated. The signatures would be device-independent (if desired, we could even require a zero-knowledge proof that they were published on a blockchain), so it would be all-or-nothing: there would be no practical way to authorize one device to keep running without authorizing all other devices.

    This feels like it "checks the boxes" in terms of maximizing benefits and minimizing risks:

    It's a useful capability to have: if we get warning signs that near-superintelligent AI is starting to do things that risk catastrophic damage, we will want to take the transition more slowly. Until such a critical moment happens, merely having the capability to soft-pause would cause little harm to developers. Focusing on industrial-scale hardware, and only aiming for 90-99% as a goal, would avoid some dystopian effort of putting spy chips or kill switches in consumer laptops or forcing draconian measures on small countries against their will. Focusing on hardware seems very robust to changes in technology. We have seen across multiple generations of AI that quality depends heavily on available compute, especially so in the early versions of a new paradigm. Hence, reducing available compute by 10-100x can easily make the difference between a runaway superintelligent AI winning or losing a fast-paced battle against humans trying to stop it. The inherent annoyingness of needing to get online once a week for a signature would create a strong pressure against extending the scheme to consumer hardware. It could be verified with random inspection, and doing it at hardware level would make it difficult to exempt specific users (approaches that are based on legally forcing shutdown, rather than technically, do not have this all-or-nothing property, which makes them have much greater risk of slippery-sloping into exemptions for militaries etc) Hardware regulation is being strongly considered already, though generally through the frame of export controls, which inherently have a "we trust our side, but not the other side" philosophy. Leopold Aschenbrenner has famously advocated that the US should race to get a decisive advantage and then essentially force China to sign a protocol limiting how many boxes they are allowed to run. To me, this approach seems risky, and could combine the flaws of multipolar races and centralization. If we have to limit people, it seems better to limit everyone on an equal footing, and do the hard work of actually trying to cooperate to organize that instead of one party seeking to dominate everyone else.

    d/acc technologies in AI risk Both of these strategies (liability and the hardware pause button) have holes in them, and it's clear that they are only temporary stopgaps: if something becomes possible to do on a supercomputer at time T, it will likely be possible on a laptop at time T + 5 years. And so we need something more stable to buy time for. Many d/acc technologies are relevant here. We can look at the role of d/acc tech as follows: if AI takes over the world, how would it do so?

    It hacks our computers ‚Üí cyber-defense
    It creates a super-plague ‚Üí bio-defense
    It convinces us (either to trust it, or to distrust each other) ‚Üí info-defense
    As briefly mentioned above, liability rules are a naturally d/acc-friendly style of regulation, because they can very efficiently motivate all parts of the world to adopt these defenses and take them seriously. Taiwan has been experimenting with liability for false advertising recently, which can be viewed as one example of using liability to encourage info defense. We should not be too enthusiastic about putting liability everywhere, and remember the benefits of plain old freedom in enabling the little guy to participate in innovation without fear of lawsuits, but where we do want a stronger push to be secure, liability can be quite flexible and effective.


    The role of crypto in d/acc
    Much of d/acc goes far beyond typical blockchain topics: biosecurity, BCI and collaborative discourse tools seem far away from things that a crypto person normally talks about. However, I think there are some important ties between crypto and d/acc, particularly:

    d/acc is an extension of the underlying values of crypto (decentralization, censorship resistance, open global economy and society) to other areas of technology. Because crypto users are natural early adopters, and there is an alignment of values, crypto communities are natural early users of d/acc technology. The heavy emphasis on community (both online and offline, eg. events and popups), and the fact that these communities actually do high-stakes things instead of just talking to each other, makes crypto communities particularly appealing incubators and testbeds for d/acc technologies that fundamentally work on groups rather than individuals (eg. a large fraction of info defense and bio defense). Crypto people just do things, together. Many crypto technologies can be used in d/acc subject areas: blockchains for building more robust and decentralized financial, governance and social media infrastructure, zero knowledge proofs for protecting privacy, etc. Today, many of the largest prediction markets are built on blockchains, and they are gradually becoming more sophisticated, decentralized and democratic. There are also win-win opportunities to collaborate on crypto-adjacent technologies that are very useful to crypto projects, but are also key to achieving d/acc goals: formal verification, computer software and hardware security, and adversarially-robust governance technology. These things make the Ethereum blockchain, wallets and DAOs more secure and robust, and they also accomplish important civilizational defense goals like reducing our vulnerability to cyberattacks, including potentially from superintelligent AI.

    Cursive, an app that uses fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to allow users to identify areas of common interest with other users, while preserving privacy. This was used at Edge City, one of the many offshoots of Zuzalu, in Chiang Mai.
    In addition to these direct intersections, there is also another crucial shared point of interest: funding mechanisms.

    d/acc and public goods funding
    One of my ongoing interests is coming up with better mechanisms to fund public goods: projects that are valuable to very large groups of people, but that do not have a naturally accessible business model. My past work on this includes my contributions to quadratic funding and its use in Gitcoin Grants, retro PGF, and more recently deep funding.

    Many people are skeptical of public goods as a concept. The skepticism generally comes from two sources:

    The fact that public goods have historically been used as a justification for heavy-handed central planning and government intervention in society and economy. A general perception that public goods funding lacks rigor and is run on social desirability bias - what sounds good, rather than what is good - and favors insiders who can play the social game. These are important critiques, and good critiques. However, I would argue that strong decentralized public goods funding is essential to a d/acc vision, because a key d/acc goal (minimizing central points of control) inherently frustrates many traditional business models. It is possible to build successful businesses on open source - several Balvi grantees are doing so - but in some situations it is hard enough that important projects needs extra ongoing support. Hence, we have to do the hard thing, and figure out how to do public goods funding in a way that addresses both of the above critiques.

    The solution to the first problem is basically credible neutrality and decentralization. Central planning is problematic because it gives control to elites who might turn abusive, and because it often overfits to the present-day situation and becomes less and less effective over time. Quadratic funding and similar mechanisms were precisely about funding public goods in a way that is as credibly neutral and (architecturally and politically) decentralized as possible.

    The second problem is more challenging. With quadratic funding, a common critique has been that it quickly becomes a popularity contest, requiring project funders to spend a lot of effort publicly campaigning. Furthermore, projects that are "in front of people's eyeballs" (eg. end-user applications) get funded, but projects that are more in the background (the archetypal "dependency maintained by a guy in Nebraska") don't get any funding at all. Optimism retro funding relies on a smaller number of expert badge holders; here, popularity contest effects are diminished, but social effects of having close personal ties with the badge holders are magnified.

    Deep funding is my own latest effort to solve this problem. Deep funding has two primary innovations:
    The dependency graph. Instead of asking each juror a global question ("what is the value of project A to humanity?"), we ask a local question ("is project A or project B more valuable to outcome C? And by how much?"). Humans are notoriously bad at global questions: in a famous study, when asked how much money they would pay to save N birds, responders answered roughly $80 for N=2,000, N=20,000 and N=200,000. Local questions are much more tractable. We then combine local answers into a global answer by maintaining a "dependency graph": for each project, what other projects contributed to its success, and how much? AI as distilled human judgement. Jurors are only each assigned a small random sample of all questions. There is an open competition through which anyone can submit AI models that try to efficiently fill in all the edges in the graph. The final answer is the weighted sum of models that is most compatible with the jury answers. See here for a code example. This approach allows the mechanism to scale to a very large size, while requiring the jury to submit only a small number of "bits" of information. This reduces opportunity for corruption, and ensures that each bit is high-quality: jurors can afford to think for a long time on each question, instead of quickly clicking through hundreds. By using an open competition of AIs, we reduce the bias from any one single AI training and administration process. Open market of AIs as the engine, humans as the steering wheel.

    But deep funding is only the latest example; there have been other public goods funding mechanism ideas before, and there will be many more in the future. allo.expert does a good job of cataloguing them. The underlying goal is to create a societal gadget that can fund public goods with a level of accuracy, fairness and open entry that at least approximates the way that markets fund private goods. It does not have to be perfect; after all, markets are far from perfect themselves. But it should be effective enough that developers working on top-quality open-source projects that benefit everyone can afford to keep doing so without feeling the need to make unacceptable compromises.

    Today, the leading projects in most d/acc subject areas: vaccines, BCI, "borderline BCI" like wrist myoelectrics and eye tracking, anti-aging medicines, hardware, etc, are proprietary. This has big downsides in terms of securing public trust, as we have seen in many of the above areas already. It also shifts attention toward competitive dynamics ("OUR TEAM must win this critical industry!"), and away from the larger competition of making sure these technologies come fast enough to be there to protect us in a world of superintelligent AI. For these reasons, robust public goods funding can be a strong booster of openness and freedom. This is another way in which the crypto community can help d/acc: by putting serious effort into exploring these funding mechanisms and making them work well within its own context, preparing them for much wider adoption for open-source science and technology more generally.

    The future
    The next few decades bring important challenges. There are two challenges that have recently been on my mind:

    Powerful new waves of technology, especially strong AI, are coming quickly, and these technologies come with important traps that we need to avoid. It may take five years for "artificial superintelligence" to get here, it may take fifty. Either way, it's not clear that the default outcome is automatically positive, and as described in this post and the previous one, there are multiple traps to avoid. The world is becoming less cooperative. Many powerful actors that before seemed to at least sometimes act on high-minded principles (cosmopolitanism, freedom, common humanity... the list goes on) are now more openly, and aggressively, pursuing personal or tribal self-interest. However, each of these challenges has a silver lining. First, we now have very powerful tools to do our remaining work more quickly:

    Present-day and near-future AI can be used to build other technologies, and can be used as an ingredient in governance (as in deep funding or info finance). It's also very relevant to BCI, which can itself provide further productivity gains. Large-scale coordination is now possible at much greater scales than before. The internet and social media extended the reach of coordination, global finance (including crypto) increased its power, and now info defense and collaboration tools can increase its quality and perhaps soon BCI in its human-to-computer-to-human form can increase its depth. Formal verification, sandboxing (web browsers, Docker, Qubes, GrapheneOS, and much more), secure hardware modules, and other technologies are improving to the point of making much better cybersecurity possible. Writing any kind of software is significantly easier than it was two years ago. Recent basic research on understanding how viruses work, especially the simple understanding that the most important form of transmission to guard against is airborne, is showing a much clearer path for how to improve bio defense. Recent advances in biotech (eg. CRISPR, advances in bio-imaging) are making all kinds of biotech, whether for defense, or longevity, or super-happiness, or exploring multiple novel bio hypotheses, or simply doing really cool things, much more accessible. Advances in computing and biotech together are enabling synthetic bio tools you can use to adapt, monitor, and improve your health. Cyber-defense tech such as cryptography makes the personalized dimension of this much more viable. Second, now that many principles that we hold dear are no longer occupied by a few particular segments of the old guard, they can be reclaimed by a broad coalition that anyone in the world is welcome to join. This is probably the biggest upside of recent political "realignments" around the world, and one that is worth taking advantage of. Crypto has already done an excellent job taking advantage of this and finding global appeal; d/acc can do the same.

    Access to tools means that we are able to adapt and improve our biologies and our environments, and the "defense" part of d/acc means that we are able to do this without infringing on others' freedom to do the same. Liberal pluralist principles mean we can have a lot of diversity on how this is done, and our commitment to common humanity goals means it should get done.
    We, humans, continue to be the brightest star. The task ahead of us, of building an even brighter 21À¢·µó century that preserves human survival and freedom and agency as we head toward the stars, is a challenging one. But I am confident that we are up to it.

  - Blog Tittle: "What I would love to see in a wallet"
    Special thanks to Liraz Siri, Yoav Weiss, and ImToken, Metamask and OKX developers for feedback and review.

    One critical layer of the Ethereum infrastructure stack, often underappreciated by core L1 researchers and developers, is the wallet. Wallets are the window between a user and the Ethereum world, and a user only benefits from any decentralization, censorship resistance, security, privacy, or other properties that Ethereum and its applications offer to the extent that the wallet itself also has these properties.

    Recently, we have seen a lot of progress on improving user experience, security and functionality of Ethereum wallets. The goal of this post is to give my own views of some of the properties that an ideal Ethereum wallet would have. This is not intended to be a complete list; reflecting my cypherpunk leanings, it focuses on security and privacy, and it is almost certainly incomplete on the user experience front. However, I would argue that wishlists are less effective for optimizing user experience than simply deploying and iterating based on feedback, and so I think it is most valuable to focus on the security and privacy properties.

    User experience of cross-L2 transactions There is now an increasingly detailed roadmap for improving cross-L2 user experience, which has a short-term part and a long-term part. Here, I will talk about the short-term part: ideas which are theoretically implementable even today.

    The core ideas are (i) built-in cross-L2 sends, and (ii) chain-specific addresses and payment requests. Your wallet should be able to give you an address that (following the style of this draft ERC) looks like this:
    0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045@optimism.eth
    When someone (or some application) gives you an address of this format, you should be able to paste it into a wallet's "to" field, and click "send". The wallet should automatically process that send in whatever way it can:

    If you already have enough coins of the needed type on the destination chain, send the coins directly If you have coins of the needed type on another chain (or multiple other chains), use a protocol like ERC-7683 (effectively a cross-chain DEX) to send the coins If you have coins of a different type on the same or other chains, use decentralized exchanges to convert them into the right type of coin on the right chain and send them. This should require explicit permission from the user: the user would see how much of what they are paying, and how much the recipient is getting.

    Mockup of possible wallet interface with cross-chain address support

    The above is for the "you copy-paste an address (or ENS, eg. vitalik.eth@optimism.eth) for someone to pay you" use case. If a dapp is requesting a deposit (eg. see this Polymarket example) then the ideal flow is to extend the web3 API and allow the dapp to make a chain-specific payment request. Your wallet would then be able to satisfy that request in whatever way it needs to. Making the user experience work well would also require standardizing a getAvailableBalance request, and wallets would need to put significant thought into which chains they store users' assets on by default to maximize security and ease of transfers.

    Chain-specific payment requests could also be put into QR codes, which mobile wallets could scan. In an in-person (or online) consumer payments scenario, the recipient would make a QR code or web3 API call that says "I want X units of token Y on chain Z, with reference ID or callback W", and the wallet would be free to satisfy that request in whatever way it can. Another option is a claim link protocol, where the user's wallet generates a QR code or URL that contains an authorization to claim a certain quantity of funds from their onchain contract, and it's the recipient's job to figure out how to then move those funds to their own wallet.

    Another related topic is gas payments. If you receive assets on an L2 where you do not yet have ETH, and you need to send a transaction on that L2, a wallet should be able to automatically use a protocol (eg. RIP-7755) to pay the gas on a chain where you do have ETH. If the wallet expects you to make more transactions on that L2 in the future, it should also just use a DEX to send over eg. a few million gas worth of ETH, so that future transactions can spend gas there directly (as this is cheaper).

    Account security One way that I conceptualize the account security challenge is that a good wallet should simultaneously be good in two areas: (i) protecting the user from the wallet developer being hacked or malicious, and (ii) protecting the user from their own mistakes.

    The typo "mistakles" on the left was unintentional. However, upon seeing it I realized that it's perfectly appropriate for the context, so I decided to keep it.

    My preferred solution to this, for over ten years, has been social recovery and multisig wallets, with graded access control. A user's account has two layers of keys: a primary key, and N guardians (eg. N = 5). The primary key is able to do low-value and non-financial operations. A majority of the guardians is required to do either (i) high-value operations, like sending away the entire value in the account, or (ii) change the primary key or any of the guardians. If desired, the primary key can be allowed to do high-value operations with a timelock.

    The above is a basic design, and can be augmented. Session keys, and permissions mechanisms like ERC-7715, can help support different balances between convenience and security for different applications. More complicated guardian architectures, such as having multiple timelock durations at different thresholds, can help maximize the chance of successful legitimate account recovery while minimizing the risk of theft.

    Who or what should the guardians be?
    For an experienced crypto user who is inside a community of experienced crypto users, a viable option is the keys of your friends and family. If you ask each one to provide you with a fresh address, then no one needs to know who they are - in fact, your guardians don't even need to know who each other are. The chance that they will collude without one of them tipping you off is tiny. For most new users, however, this option is not available.

    A second option is institutional guardians: firms that specialize in performing the service of only signing a transaction if they get some other confirmation that a request is coming from you: eg. a confirmation code, or for high-value users a video call. People have attempted to make these for a long time, eg. I profiled CryptoCorp in 2013. However, so far such firms have not been very successful.
    A third option is multiple personal devices (eg. phone, desktop, hardware wallet). This can work, but also is difficult to set up and manage for inexperienced users. There is also the risk of devices being lost or stolen at the same time, especially if they are at the same location.

    Recently, we have started to see more wallets based on passkeys. Passkeys can be backed up on your devices only, making them a type of personal-device solution, or backed up in the cloud, making their security dependent on a complicated hybrid of password security, institutional and trusted hardware assumptions. Realistically, passkeys are a valuable security gain for ordinary users, but they alone are not strong enough to protect a user's life savings.

    Fortunately, with ZK-SNARKs, we have a fourth option: ZK-wrapped centralized ID. This genre includes zk-email, Anon Aadhaar, Myna Wallet, and many others. Basically, you can take many forms of (corporate or governmental) centralized ID, and turn it into an Ethereum address, which you can only send transactions from by generating a ZK-SNARK proving possession of the centralized ID.

    With this addition, we now have a wide array of options, and ZK-wrapped centralized ID is uniquely "noob-friendly".

    For this to work, it needs to be implemented with a streamlined and integrated UI: you should be able to just specify that you want "example@gmail.com" as a guardian, and it should automatically generate the corresponding zk-email Ethereum address under the hood. Advanced users should be able to enter their email (along with perhaps a salt value for privacy, that would be saved in that email) into an open-source third-party application, and confirm that the address generated is correct. The same should be true for any other supported guardian type.

    Mockup of possible Safe interface
    Note that today, one practical challenge with zk-email specifically is that it depends on DKIM signatures, which use keys that are rotated once every few months, and these keys are not themselves signed by any other authority. This means that zk-email today has some level of trust requirement beyond the provider themselves; this could be reduced if zk-email used TLSNotary inside trusted hardware to verify updated keys, but it's not ideal. Hopefully, email providers will start signing their DKIM keys directly. Today, I would recommend using zk-email for one guardian, but not for a majority of your guardians: do not store funds in a setup where zk-email breaking means that you lose access to your funds.

    New users and in-app wallets
    New users realistically will not want to have to enter a large number of guardians in their first signup experience. Hence, wallets should offer them a very simple option. One natural route is a 2-of-3 using zk-email on their email address, a key stored locally on the user's device (which could be a passkey), and a backup key held by the provider. As a user becomes more experienced, or accrues more assets, at some point they should be prompted to add more guardians.

    Wallets integrated in applications are inevitable, because applications trying to appeal to non-crypto users do not want the confusing user experience of asking their users to download two new applications (the app itself, plus an Ethereum wallet) at the same time. However, a user of many application wallets should be able to link all of their wallets together, so that they only have one "access control thing" to worry about. The simplest way to do this is a hierarchical scheme, where there is a fast "linking" process that allows a user to set their primary wallet to be the guardian of all of their in-app wallets. The Farcaster client Warpcast supports this already:

    By default, your Warpcast account's recovery is controlled by the Warpcast team. However, you can "take sovereignty over" your Farcaster account, and change the recovery to your own address.

    Protecting users from scams and other external threats In addition to account security, wallets today do a lot to identify fake addresses, phishing, scams and other external threats, and try to protect their users from such threats. At the same time, many of the countermeasures are still quite primitive: for example, requiring a clickthrough to send ETH or other tokens to any new address, regardless of whether you're sending $100 or $100,000. Here, there is no single magic-bullet solution; it's a series of slow ongoing fixes and improvements to different categories of threats. However, there is a lot of value in continuing to do the hard work to improve here.

    Privacy
    Now is the time to start taking privacy on Ethereum much more seriously. ZK-SNARK technology is now very advanced, privacy technologies that mitigate regulatory risks without relying on backdoors, such as Privacy Pools, are growing more mature, and secondary infrastructure like Waku and ERC-4337 mempools is slowly becoming more stable. However, up until now, making private transfers on Ethereum has required users to explicitly download and use a "privacy wallet", such as Railway (or Umbra for stealth addresses). This adds great inconvenience and reduces the number of people who are willing to make private transfers. The solution is that private transfers need to be integrated directly into wallets.

    A simple implementation is as follows. A wallet could store some portion of a user's assets as a "private balance" in a privacy pool. When a user makes a transfer, it would automatically withdraw from the privacy pool first. If a user needs to receive funds, the wallet could automatically generate a stealth address.

    Additionally, a wallet could automatically generate a new address for each application that a user participates in (eg. a defi protocol). Deposits would come from the privacy pool, and withdrawals would go straight into the privacy pool. This allows a user's activity in any one application to be unlinked from their activity in other applications.

    One advantage of this technique is that it is a natural pathway to not just privacy-preserving asset transfer, but also privacy-preserving identity. Identity happens onchain already: any application that uses proof-of-personhood gating (eg. Gitcoin Grants), any token-gated chat, the Ethereum Follow Protocol, and much more are all onchain identity. We want this ecosystem to also be privacy-preserving. This means that a user's activity onchain should not be collected in one place: each item should be stored separately, and the user's wallet should be the only thing with a "global view" that sees all of your attestations at the same time. A natively many-accounts-per-user ecosystem helps accomplish this, as do offchain attestation protocols like EAS and Zupass.

    This represents a pragmatic vision for Ethereum privacy in the medium-term future. It can be implemented today, although there are features that can be introduced at L1 and L2 to make privacy-preserving transfers more efficient and reliable. Some privacy advocates argue that the only acceptable thing is total privacy of everything: encrypting the entire EVM. I would argue that this may be ideal as a long-term outcome, but it requires a much more fundamental rethink of programming models, and it's currently not at the level of maturity where it's ready to go and deploy across Ethereum. We do need privacy-by-default to get sufficiently large anonymity sets. However, focusing first on making (i) transfers between accounts, and (ii) identity and identity-adjacent use cases like attestations private is a pragmatic first step that is far easier to implement, and which wallets can get started on today.

    Ethereum wallets need to also become data wallets One consequence of any effective privacy solution, whether for payments or for identity or other use cases, is that it creates a need for the user to store offchain data. This was obvious in Tornado Cash, which required users to save each individual "note" representing a 0.1-100 ETH deposit. More modern privacy protocols sometimes save the data encrypted onchain, and use a single private key to decrypt it. This is risky, because if the key is ever leaked, or if quantum computers ever become viable, the data all becomes public. Offchain attestations like EAS and Zupass have an even more obvious need for offchain data storage.

    Wallets need to become not just software to store onchain access permissions, but also software to store your private data. This is something that the non-crypto world is increasingly recognizing as well, eg. see Tim Berners-Lee's recent work in personal data stores. All of the problems that we need to solve around robustly guaranteeing control of access permissions, we also need to solve around robustly guaranteeing accessibility and non-leakage of data. Perhaps the solutions could be overlaid together: if you have N guardians, use M-of-N secret sharing between those same N guardians to store your data. Data is inherently harder to secure, because you can't revoke someone's share of it, but we should come up with decentralized custody solutions that are as secure as we can.

    Secure chain access
    Today, wallets trust their RPC providers to tell them any information about a chain. This is a vulnerability in two ways:

    The RPC provider could attempt to steal money by feeding them false information, eg. about market prices. The RPC provider could extract private information about what applications and other accounts a user is interacting with. Ideally, we want to plug both of these holes. To plug the first, we need standardized light clients for L1 and L2s, which directly verify the blockchain consensus. Helios already does this for L1, and has been doing some preliminary work to support some specific L2s. To properly cover all L2s, what we need is a standard by which a config contract representing an L2 (also used for chain-specific addresses) can declare a function, perhaps in a manner similar to ERC-3668, containing the logic for obtaining recent state roots, and verifying proofs of state and receipts against those state roots. This way we could have a universal light client, allowing wallets to securely verify any state or events on L1 and L2.

    For privacy, today the only realistic approach is to run your own full node. However, now that L2s are entering the picture, running a full node of everything is getting increasingly hard. The equivalent to a light client here is private information retrieval (PIR). PIR involves a server holding a copy of all the data, and a client sending the server an encrypted request. The server performs a computation over all the data, which returns the client's desired data, encrypted to the client's key, without revealing to the server which piece of data the client accessed.

    To keep the server honest, the individual database items would themselves be Merkle branches, so the client could verify them using their light client.

    PIR is very computationally expensive. There are several routes around this problem:

    Brute force: improvements in algorithms, or specialized hardware, could potentially make PIR fast enough to run. These techniques may depend on pre-processing: servers could store encrypted-and-shuffled data for each client, and clients could query that data. The main challenge in the Ethereum setting is adapting these techniques to datasets that change rapidly (as the state does). This makes real-time computational costs lower, but may well make total computational and storage costs higher.
    Weaken the privacy requirement: for example, each lookup could only have 1 million "mixins", so the server would know a million possible values that the client could have accessed, but not any finer granularity
    Multi-server PIR: PIR algorithms are often much faster if you use multiple servers with a 1-of-N honesty assumption between those servers.
    Anonymity instead of confidentiality: instead of hiding the contents of the request, the request could be sent through a mixnet, hiding the sender of the request. However, doing this effectively inevitably increases latency, worsening the user experience.
    Figuring out the right combination of techniques to maximize privacy while maintaining practicality in the Ethereum context is an open research problem, and I welcome cryptographers trying their hand at it.

    Ideal keystore wallets Aside from transfers and state access, one other important workflow that needs to work smoothly in a cross-L2 context is changing an account's validation configuration: whether changing its keys (eg. recovery), or a deeper change to the account's entire logic. Here, there are three tiers of solutions, in increasing order of how difficult they are:

    Replayed updates: when a user changes their configuration, a message authorizing this change is replayed on every chain where the wallet detects that a user has assets. Potentially, the message format and validation rules can be made chain-independent, so it can be automatically replayed on as many chains as possible.
    Keystores on L1: the config information lives on L1, and the wallet on L2 reads it with an L1SLOAD or REMOTESTATICCALL. This way, updating the config needs to be done only on L1, and the config becomes effective automatically.
    Keystores on L2: the config information lives on L2, and the wallet on L2 reads it with a ZK-SNARK. This is the same as (2), except keystore updates can be cheaper, though on the other hand reads are more expensive.

    Solution (3) is particularly powerful because it stacks well with privacy. In a normal "privacy solution", a user has a secret s , a "leaf value" L is published on chain, and a user proves that L = hash(s, 1) and N = hash(s, 2) for some (never-revealed) secret that they control. The nullifier N gets published, making sure that future spends of the same leaf fail, without ever revealing L. This depends on the user keeping s safe. A recovery-friendly privacy solution would instead say: s is a location (eg. address and storage slot) onchain, and the user must prove a state query: L = hash(sload(s), 1) .

    Dapp security The weakest link in a user's security is often the dapp. Most of the time, a user interacts with an application by going to a website, which implicitly downloads the user interface code in real-time from a server and then executes it in-browser. If the server is hacked, or if the DNS is hacked, the user will get a fake copy of the interface, which could trick the user into doing arbitrary things. Wallet features like transaction simulations are very helpful in mitigating the risks, but they are far from perfect.

    Ideally, we would move the ecosystem to on-chain content versioning: a user would access a dapp via its ENS name, which would contain the IPFS hash of the interface. An onchain transaction from a multisig or DAO would be needed to update the interface. Wallets would show users if they're interacting with a more-secure onchain interface, or a less-secure web2 interface. Wallets can also show users if they're interacting with a secure chain (eg. stage 1+, multiple security audits).

    For privacy-conscious users, wallets can also add a paranoid mode, which requires users to clickthrough accept HTTP requests, and not just web3 operations:

    Mockup of possible interface for paranoid mode

    A more advanced approach would be to move beyond HTML + Javascript, and write the business logic of dapps in a dedicated language, perhaps a relatively thin overlay over Solidity or Vyper. Browsers could then automatically generate a UI for any needed functionality. OKContract is doing this already.

    Another direction is cryptoeconomic info-defense: dapp developers, security firms, chain deployers and others can put up a bond that would get paid out to affected users if a dapp was hacked or otherwise harmed users by acting in a highly misleading way, as determined by some onchain adjudication DAO. The wallet could show a user a score that is based on the size of the bond.

    The longer-term future The above was all in the context of conventional interfaces, which involve pointing and clicking on things and entering things into text fields. However, we are also on the cusp of paradigms changing much more deeply:

    AI, which could lead to us moving away from a point-and-click-and-type paradigm to a paradigm of "say what you want to do, and the bot figures it out" Brain-computer interfaces, both "mild" approaches like eye tracking as well as more direct and even invasive techniques (see: first Neuralink patient this year) Clients engaging in active defense: the Brave browser actively protects users against ads, trackers and many other undesirable objects. Many browsers, plugins and crypto wallets have entire teams actively working to protect users against all kinds of security and privacy threats. These kinds of "active guardians" will become only more powerful in the coming decade. These three trends together will lead to much deeper rethinking of how interfaces work. Through natural language input, eye tracking, or eventually more direct BCI, together with knowledge of your history (perhaps including text messages, as long as all data is processed locally), a "wallet" could get a clear intuitive idea of what you want to do. AI could then translate that intuition into a concrete "action plan": a series of onchain and offchain interactions that accomplish what you want. This could greatly reduce the need for third-party user interfaces entirely. If a user does interact with a third-party application (or another user), the AI should think adversarially on the user's behalf, and identify any threats and suggest action plans for avoiding them. Ideally, there would be an open ecosystem of these AIs, produced by different groups with different biases and incentive structures.

    These more radical ideas depend on technology that is extremely immature today, and so I would not put my assets today into a wallet that relies on them. However, something like this seems to be pretty clearly the future, and so it's worth starting to more actively explore in that direction.

  - Blog Tittle: "From prediction markets to info finance"
    Special thanks to Robin Hanson and Alex Tabarrok for feedback and review

    One of the Ethereum applications that has always excited me the most are prediction markets. I wrote about futarchy, a model of prediction-based governance conceived by Robin Hanson, in 2014. I was an active user and supporter of Augur back in 2015 (look, mommy, my name is in the Wikipedia article!). I earned $58,000 betting on the election in 2020. And this year, I have been a close supporter and follower of Polymarket.

    To many people, prediction markets are about betting on elections, and betting on elections is gambling - nice if it helps people enjoy themselves, but fundamentally not more interesting than buying random coins on pump.fun. From this perspective, my interest in prediction markets may seem confusing. And so in this post I aim to explain what it is about the concept that excites me. In short, I believe that (i) prediction markets even as they exist today are a very useful tool for the world, but furthermore (ii) prediction markets are only one example of a much larger incredibly powerful category, with potential to create better implementations of social media, science, news, governance, and other fields. I shall label this category "info finance".

    The two faces of Polymarket: a betting site for the participants, a news site for everyone else
    In the past week, Polymarket has been a very effective source of information about the US election. Not only did Polymarket predict Trump would win with 60/40 odds while other sources predicted 50/50 (not too impressive by itself), it also showed other virtues: when the results were coming out, while many pundits and news sources kept stringing viewers along with hope of some kind of favorable news for Kamala, Polymarket showed the direct truth: Trump had a greater than 95% chance of victory, and a greater than 90% chance of seizing control of all branches of government at the same time.

    But to me this is not even the best example of why Polymarket is interesting. So let us go to a different example: the elections in Venezuela in July. The day after the election happened, I remember seeing out of the corner of my eye something about people protesting a highly manipulated election result in Venezuela. At first, I thought nothing of it. I knew that Maduro was one of those "basically a dictator" figures already, and so I figured, of course he would fake every election outcome to keep himself in power, of course some people would protest, and of course the protest would fail - as, unfortunately, so many others do. But then I was scrolling Polymarket, and I saw this:

    People were willing to put over a hundred thousand dollars on the line, betting that there is a 23% chance that this election would be the one where Maduro would actually get struck down. Now I was paying attention.

    Of course, we know the unfortunate result of this situation. Ultimately, Maduro did stay in power. However, the markets clued me in to the fact that this time, the attempt to unseat Maduro was serious. There were huge protests, and the opposition played a surprisingly well-executed strategy to prove to the world just how fraudulent the elections were. Had I not received the initial signal from Polymarket that "this time, there is something to pay attention to", I would not have even started paying that much attention.

    You should never trust the charts entirely: if everyone trusts the charts, then anyone with money can manipulate the charts and no one will dare to bet against them. On the other hand, trusting the news entirely is also a bad idea. News has an incentive to be sensational, and play up the consequences of anything for clicks. Sometimes, this is justified, sometimes it's not. If you see a sensational article, but then you go to the market and you see that probabilities on relevant events have not changed at all, it makes sense to be suspicious. Alternatively, if you see an unexpectedly high or low probability on the market, or an unexpectedly sudden change, that's a signal to read through the news and see what might have caused it. Conclusion: you can be more informed by reading the news and the charts, than by reading either one alone.

    Let's recap that's going on here. If you are a bettor, then you can deposit to Polymarket, and for you it's a betting site. If you are not a bettor, then you can read the charts, and for you it's a news site. You should never trust the charts entirely, but I personally have already incorporated reading the charts as one step in my information-gathering workflow (alongside traditional media and social media), and it has helped me become more informed more efficiently.

    Info finance, more broadly
    Now, we get to the important part: predicting the election is just the first app. The broader concept is that you can use finance as a way to align incentives in order to provide viewers with valuable information. Now, one natural response is: isn't all finance fundamentally about information? Different actors make different buy and sell decisions because of different opinions about what will happen in the future (in addition to personal needs like risk preferences and desire to hedge), and you can read market prices to infer a lot of knowledge about the world.

    To me, info finance is that, but correct by construction. Similar to the concept of correct-by-construction in software engineering, info finance is a discipline where you (i) start from a fact that you want to know, and then (ii) deliberately design a market to optimally elicit that information from market participants.

    Info finance as a three-sided market: bettors make predictions, readers read predictions. The market outputs predictions about the future as a public good (because that's what it was designed to do).

    One example of this is prediction markets: you want to know a specific fact that will take place in the future, and so you set up a market for people to bet on that fact. Another example is decision markets: you want to know whether decision A or decision B will produce a better outcome according to some metric M. To achieve this, you set up conditional markets: you ask people to bet on (i) which decision will be chosen, (ii) value of M if decision A is chosen, otherwise zero, (iii) value of M if decision B is chosen, otherwise zero. Given these three variables, you can figure out if the market thinks decision A or decision B is more bullish for the value of M.

    One technology that I expect will turbocharge info finance in the next decade is AI (whether LLMs or some future technology). This is because many of the most interesting applications of info finance are on "micro" questions: millions of mini-markets for decisions that individually have relatively low consequence. In practice, markets with low volume often do not work effectively: it does not make sense for a sophisticated participant to spend the time to make a detailed analysis just for the sake of a few hundred dollars of profit, and many have even argued that without subsidies such markets won't work at all because on all but the most large and sensational questions, there are not enough naive traders for sophisticated traders to take profit from. AI changes that equation completely, and means that we could potentially get reasonably high-quality info elicited even on markets with $10 of volume. Even if subsidies are required, the size of the subsidy per question becomes extremely affordable.

    Info finance for distilled human judgement
    Suppose that you have a human judgement mechanism that you trust, and that has the legitimacy of a whole community trusting it, but which takes a long time and a high cost to make a judgement. However, you want access to at least an approximate copy of that "costly mechanism" cheaply and in real time. Here is Robin Hanson's idea for what you can do: every time you need to make a decision, you set up a prediction market on what outcome the costly mechanism would make on the decision if it was called. You let the prediction market run, and put in a small amount of money to subsidize market makers.

    99.99% of the time, you don't actually call the costly mechanism: perhaps you "revert the trades" and give everyone back what they put in, or you just give everyone zero, or you see if the average price was closer to 0 or 1 and treat that as the ground truth. 0.01% of the time - perhaps randomly, perhaps for the highest-volume markets, perhaps some combination of both - you actually run the costly mechanism, and compensate participants based on that.

    This gives you a credibly neutral fast and cheap "distilled version" of your original highly trustworthy but highly costly mechanism (using the word "distilled" as an analogy to LLM distillation). Over time, this distilled mechanism roughly mirrors the original mechanism's behavior - because only the participants that help it have that outcome make money, and the others lose money.

    Mockup of possible prediction markets + Community Notes combo.

    This has applications not just in social media, but also for DAOs. A major problem of DAOs is that there is such a large number of decisions that most people are not willing to participate in most of them, leading to either widespread use of delegation, with risk of the same kinds of centralization and principal-agent failures we see in representative democracy, or vulnerability to attack. A DAO where actual votes only happen very rarely, and most things are decided by prediction markets with some combination of humans and AI predicting the votes, could work well.

    Just as we saw in the decision markets example, info finance contains many potential paths to solving important problems in decentralized governance. The key is the balance between market and non-market: the market is the "engine", and some other non-financialized trustworthy mechanism is the "steering wheel".

    Other use cases of info finance
    Personal tokens - the genre of projects such as Bitclout (now deso), friend.tech and many others that create a token for each person and make it easy to speculate on these tokens - are a category that I would call "proto info-finance". They are deliberately creating market prices for specific variables - namely, expectations of future prominence of a person - but the exact information being uncovered by the prices is too unspecific and subject to reflexivity and bubble dynamics. There is a possibility to create improved versions of such protocols, and use them to solve important problems like talent discovery, by being more careful about the economic design of a token, particularly where its ultimate value comes from. Robin Hanson's idea of prestige futures is one possible end state here.

    Advertising - the ultimate "expensive but trustworthy signal" is whether or not you will buy a product. Info finance based off of that signal could be used to help people to identify what to buy.

    Scientific peer review - there is an ongoing "replication crisis" in science where famous results that have in some cases become part of folk wisdom end up not being reproduced at all by newer studies. We can try to identify results that need re-checking with a prediction market. Before the re-checking is done, such a market would also give readers a quick estimate of how much they should trust any specific result. Experiments of this idea have been done, and so far seem successful.

    Public goods funding - one of the main problems with public goods funding mechanisms used in Ethereum is the "popularity contest" nature of them. Each contributor needs to run their own marketing operation on social media in order to get recognized, and contributors who are not well-equipped to do this, or who have inherently more "background" roles, have a hard time getting significant amounts of money. An appealing solution to this is to try to track an entire dependency graph: for each positive outcome, which projects contributed how much to it, and then for each of those projects, which projects contributed how much to that, and so on. The main challenge in this kind of design is figuring out the weights of the edges in a way that is resistant to manipulation - after all, such manipulation happens all the time already. A distilled human judgement mechanism could potentially help.

    Conclusions
    These ideas have been theorized about for a long time: the earliest writings about prediction markets and even decision markets are decades old, and theory of finance saying similar things is even older. However, I would argue that the current decade presents a unique opportunity, for several key reasons:

    Info finance solves trust problems that people actually have. A common concern of this era is the lack of knowledge (and worse, lack of consensus) about whom to trust, in political, scientific and commercial contexts. Info finance applications could help be part of the solution.
    We now have scalable blockchains as the substrate. Up until very recently, fees were too high to actually implement most of these ideas. Now, they are no longer too high.
    AIs as participants. Info finance is relatively difficult to make work when it must depend on humans to participate on each question. AIs greatly improve this situation, enabling effective markets even on small-scale questions. Many markets will likely have a combination of AI and human participants, especially as volume on specific questions suddenly switches from small to large.
    To take full advantage of this opportunity, it's time to go beyond just predicting elections, and explore the rest of what info finance can bring us.

    Possible futures of the Ethereum protocol, part 6: The Splurge

    Special thanks to Justin Drake, Tim Beiko and Yoav Weiss for feedback and review

    Some things are just not easy to put into a single category. There are lots of "little things" in Ethereum protocol design that are very valuable for Ethereum's success, but don't fit nicely into a larger sub-category. In practice, about half of which has ended up being about EVM improvements of various kinds, and the rest is made up of various niche topics. This is what "the Splurge" is for.

    The Splurge, 2023 roadmap

    The Splurge: key goals
    Bring the EVM to a performant and stable "endgame state"
    Bring account abstraction in-protocol, allowing all users to benefit from much more secure and convenient accounts
    Optimize transaction fee economics, increasing scalability while reducing risks
    Explore advanced cryptography that could make Ethereum far better in the long run
    In this chapter
    EVM improvements
    Account abstraction
    EIP-1559 improvements
    VDFs
    Obfuscation and one-shot signatures: the far future of cryptography

    EVM improvements
    What problem does it solve?
    The EVM today is difficult to statically analyze, making it difficult to create highly efficient implementations, formally verify code, and make further extensions to over time. Additionally, it is highly inefficient, making it difficult to implement many forms of advanced cryptography unless they are explicitly supported through precompiles.

    What is it, and how does it work?
    The first step in the current EVM improvement roadmap, scheduled to be included in the next hard fork, is the EVM Object Format (EOF). EOF is a series of EIPs that specifies a new version of EVM code that has a number of distinct features, most notably:

    Separation between code (executable, but not readable from the EVM) and data (readable, but not executable)
    Dynamic jumps banned, static jumps only.
    EVM code can no longer observe gas-related information.
    A new explicit subroutine mechanism is added.

    Structure of EOF code

    Old-style contracts would continue to exist and be createable, although there is a possible path to deprecate old-style contracts (and perhaps even force-convert them to EOF code) eventually. New-style contracts would benefit from efficiency gains created by EOF - first, from slightly smaller bytecode taking advantage of the subroutine feature, and later from new EOF-specific features, or EOF-specific gas cost decreases.

    After EOF is introduced, it becomes easier to introduce further upgrades. The most well-developed today is the EVM Modular Arithmetic Extensions (EVM-MAX). EVM-MAX creates a new set of operations specifically designed for modular arithmetic, and puts them into a new memory space that cannot be accessed with other opcodes. This enables the use of optimizations, such as Montgomery multiplication.

    A newer idea is to combine EVM-MAX with a single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) feature. SIMD has been around as an idea for Ethereum for a long time starting with Greg Colvin's EIP-616. SIMD can be used to speed up many forms of cryptography, including hash functions, 32-bit STARKs, and lattice-based cryptography. EVM-MAX plus SIMD make for a natural pair of performance-oriented extensions to the EVM.

    An approximate design for a combined EIP would be to take EIP-6690 as a starting point, and then:

    Allow (i) any odd number or (ii) any power of 2 up to 2768 as a modulus
    For each EVMMAX opcode (add, sub, mul) add a version which, instead of taking 3 immediates x, y, z, takes 7 immediates: x_start, x_skip, y_start, y_skip, z_start, z_skip, count . In python code, these opcodes would do something equivalent to:

    for i in range(count):
        mem[z_start + z_skip * count] = op(
            mem[x_start + x_skip * count],
            mem[y_start + y_skip * count]
        )
    Except in an actual implementation, it would be processed in parallel.
    Potentially, add XOR, AND, OR, NOT and SHIFT (both cyclic and noncyclic), at least for power-of-two moduli. Also add ISZERO (which pushes the output to EVM main stack)
    This would be powerful enough to implement elliptic curve cryptography, small-field cryptography (eg. Poseidon, circle STARKs), conventional hash functions (eg. SHA256, KECCAK, BLAKE), and lattice-based cryptography.

    Other EVM upgrades may also be possible, but so far they have seen much less attention.

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    Currently, EOF is scheduled to be included in the next hard fork. While there is always a possibility to remove it - features have been last-minute-removed from hard forks before - doing so would be an uphill battle. Removing EOF would imply making any future upgrades to the EVM without EOF, which can be done but may be more difficult.

    The main tradeoff in EVM is L1 complexity versus infrastructure complexity. EOF is a significant amount of code to add to EVM implementations, and the static code checks are pretty complex. In exchange, however, we get simplifications to higher-level languages, simplifications to EVM implementations, and other benefits. Arguably, a roadmap which prioritizes continued improvement to the Ethereum L1 would include and build on EOF.

    One important piece of work to do is to implement something like EVM-MAX plus SIMD and benchmark how much gas various cryptographic operations would take.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    The L1 adjusting its EVM makes it easier for L2s to do the same. One adjusting without the other creates some incompatibilities, which has its own downsides. Additionally, EVM-MAX plus SIMD can reduce gas costs for many proof systems, enabling more efficient L2s. It also makes it easier to remove more precompiles, by replacing them with EVM code that can perform the same task perhaps without a large penalty to efficiency.

    Account abstraction
    What problem does it solve?
    Today, a transaction can only be verified in one way: ECDSA signatures. Originally, account abstraction was meant to expand beyond this, and allow an account's verification logic to be arbitrary EVM code. This could enable a range of applications:

    Switching to quantum-resistant cryptography
    Rotating out old keys (widely understood to be a recommended security practice)
    Multisig wallets and social recovery wallets
    Signing with one key for low-value operations and another key (or set of keys) for high-value operations
    Allowing privacy protocols to work without relayers, significantly lowering their complexity and removing a key central point of dependency
    Since account abstraction began in 2015, the goals have expanded to also include a large set of "convenience goals", such as an account that has no ETH but has some ERC20 being able to pay gas in that ERC20. Instead of the account abstraction roadmap just abstracting validation, it aims to abstract everyghing: authentication (who can perform an action), authorization (what can they do), replay protection, gas payment and execution. One summary of these goals is the following chart:

    MPC here is multi-party computation: a 40-year-old technique to split a key into multiple pieces that are stored on multiple devices, and use cryptographic techniques to generate a signature without combining the pieces of the key directly.

    EIP-7702 is an EIP planned to be introduced in the next hard fork. EIP-7702 is the result of the growing recognition of a need to give the convenience benefits of account abstraction to all users, including EOA users, to improve user experience for everyone in the short term, and in a way that avoids bifurcation into two ecosystems. This work started with EIP-3074, and culminated in EIP-7702. EIP-7702 makes the "convenience features" of account abstraction available to all users, including EOAs (externally-owned accounts, ie. accounts controlled by ECDSA signatures), today.

    As we can see from the chart, while some challenges (especially the "convenience" challenges) can be solved with incremental techniques such as multi-party computation or EIP-7702, the bulk of the security goals that motivated the original account abstraction proposal can only be solved by going back and solving the original problem: allowing smart contract code to control transaction verification. The reason why this has not been done so far is that implementing it safely is a challenge.

    What is it, and how does it work?
    At the core, account abstraction is simple: allow transactions to be initiated by smart contracts, and not just EOAs. The entire complexity comes from doing this in a way that is friendly to maintaining a decentralized network and protecting against denial of service attacks.

    One illustrative example of a key challenge is the multi-invalidation problem:

    If there are 1000 accounts whose validation function all depends on some single value S , and there are transactions in the mempool that are valid given the current value of S , then one single transaction flipping the value of S could invalidate all of the other transactions in the mempool. This allows for an attacker to spam the mempool, clogging up the resources of nodes on the network, at a very low cost.

    Years of effort trying to expand functionality while limiting DoS risks have led to convergence on one solution for how to implement "ideal account abstraction": ERC-4337.

    ERC-4337 works by dividing processing of user operations into two phases: validation and execution. All validations are processed first, and all executions are processed second. In the mempool, a user operation is only accepted if its validation phase only touches its own account (plus a few special-case extensions, see "associated storage" in ERC-7562), and does not read environmental variables. This prevents multi-invalidation attacks. A strict gas limit on the validation step is also enforced.

    ERC-4337 was designed as an extra-protocol standard (an ERC), because at the time the Ethereum client developers were focused on the Merge, and did not have any spare capacity to work on other features. This is why ERC-4337 uses its own object called user operations, instead of regular transactions. More recently, however, we have been realizing that there is a need to enshrine at least parts of it in the protocol. Two key reasons are:

    The inherent inefficiencies of the EntryPoint being a contract: a flat ~100k gas overhead per bundle and thousands extra per user operation
    The need to make sure Ethereum properties such as inclusion guarantees created by inclusion lists carry over to account abstraction users.
    Additionally, ERC-4337 has been extended by two features:

    Paymasters: a feature that allows an account to pay fees on behalf of another account. This violates the rule that only the sender account itself can be accessed during the validation phase, so special handling is introduced to allow the paymaster mechanism and ensure that it is safe.
    Aggregators: a feature that supports signature aggregation, such as BLS aggregation or SNARK-based aggregation. This is needed to enable the highest level of data efficiency on rollups.

    EIP-7701 (EOF-based enshrined AA): https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7701
    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    The main remaining thing to figure out is how to fully bring account abstraction into the protocol. A recently popular enshrined account abstraction EIP is EIP-7701, which implements account abstraction on top of EOF. An account can have a separate code section for validation, and if an account has that code section set, that is the code gets executed during the validation step of a transaction from that account.

    EOF code structure for an EIP-7701 account

    What is fascinating about this approach is that it makes it clear that there are two equivalent ways to view native account abstraction:

    EIP-4337, but as part of the protocol
    A new type of EOA, where the signature algorithm is EVM code execution
    If we start with strict bounds on the complexity of code that can be executed during validation - allowing no external state access, and even at first setting a gas limit too low to be useful for quantum-resistant or privacy-preserving applications - then the safety of this approach is very clear: it's just swapping out ECDSA verification for an EVM code execution that takes a similar amount of time. However, over time we would need to loosen these bounds, because allowing privacy-preserving applications to work without relayers, and quantum resistance, are both very important. And in order to do this, we do need to find ways to address the DoS risks in a more flexible way, without requiring the validation step to be ultra-minimalistic.

    The main tradeoff seems to be "enshrine something that fewer people are happy with, sooner" versus "wait longer, and perhaps get a more ideal solution". The ideal approach will likely be some hybrid approach. One hybrid approach is to enshrine some use cases more quickly, and leave more time to figure out others. Another is to deploy more ambitious versions of account abstraction on L2s first. However, this has the challenge that for an L2 team to be willing to do the work to adopt a proposal, they need to be confident that L1 and/or other L2s will adopt something compatible later on.

    Another application that we need to think about explicitly is keystore accounts, which store account-related state on either L1 or a dedicated L2, but can be used both L1 and any compatible L2. Doing this effectively likely requires L2s to support opcodes such as L1SLOAD or REMOTESTATICCALL, though it also requires account abstraction implementations on L2 to support it.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    Inclusion lists need to support account abstracted transactions. In practice, the needs of inclusion lists and the needs of decentralized mempools end up being pretty similar, though there is slightly more flexibility for inclusion lists. Additionally, account abstraction implementations should ideally be harmonized on L1 and L2 as much as possible. If, in the future, we expect most users to be using keystore rollups, the account abstraction designs should be built with this in mind. Gas payment abstraction should also be designed with cross-chain use cases in mind (see eg. RIP-7755).

    EIP-1559 improvements
    What problem does it solve?
    EIP-1559 activated on Ethereum in 2021, and led to significant improvements in average block inclusion time.


    However, the current implementation of EIP-1559 is imperfect in several ways:

    The formula is slightly flawed: instead of targeting 50% blocks it targets ~50-53% full blocks depending on variance (this has to do with what mathematicians call the "AM-GM inequality")
    It doesn't adjust fast enough in extreme conditions.
    The formula later used for blobs (EIP-4844) was explicitly designed to address the first concern, and is overall cleaner. Neither EIP-1559 itself, nor EIP-4844, attempt to address the second problem. As a result, the status quo is a confusing halfway state involving two different mechanisms, and there is even a case that over time both will need to be improved.

    In addition to this, there are other weaknesses of Ethereum resource pricing that are independent of EIP-1559, but which could be solved by tweaks to EIP-1559. A major one is average case vs worst case discrepancies: resource prices in Ethereum have to be set to be able to handle the worst case, where a block's entire gas consumption takes up one resource, but average-case use is much less than this, leading to inefficiencies.

    What is it, and how does it work?
    A solution to these inefficiencies is multidimensional gas: having separate prices and limits for separate resources. This concept is technically independent from EIP-1559, but EIP-1559 makes it easier: without EIP-1559, optimally packing a block with multiple resource constraints is a complicated multidimensional knapsack problem. With EIP-1559, most blocks are not at full capacity on any resource, and so the simple algorithm of "accept anything that pays a sufficient fee" suffices.

    We have multidimensional gas for execution and blobs today; in principle, we could increase this to more dimensions: calldata, state reads/writes, and state size expansion.

    EIP-7706 introduces a new gas dimension for calldata. At the same time, it streamlines the multidimensional gas mechanism by making all three types of gas fall under one (EIP-4844-style) framework, thus also solving the mathematical flaws with EIP-1559.

    EIP-7623 is a more surgical solution to the average case vs worst case resource problem that more strictly bounds max calldata without introducing a whole new dimension.

    A further direction to go would be to tackle the update rate problem, and find a basefee calculation algorithm that is faster, and at the same time preserves the key invariants introduced by the EIP-4844 mechanism (namely: in the long run average usage approaches exactly the target).

    Multidimensional gas: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/05/09/multidim.html
    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    Multidimensional gas has two primary tradeoffs:

    It adds complexity to the protocol
    It adds complexity to the optimal algorithm needed to fill a block to capacity
    Protocol complexity is a relatively small issue for calldata, but becomes a larger issue for gas dimensions that are "inside the EVM", such as storage reads and writes. The problem is that it's not just users that set gas limits: it's also contracts that set limits when they call other contracts. And today, the only way they have to set limits is one-dimensional.

    One easy way to eliminate this problem is to make multidimensional gas only available inside EOF, because EOF does not allow contracts to set gas limits in calls to other contracts. Non-EOF contracts would have to pay a fee in all types of gas when making a storage operation (eg. if an SLOAD costs 0.03% of a block's storage access gas limit, the non-EOF user would also be charged 0.03% of the execution gas limit)

    More research on multidimensional gas would be very helpful in understanding the tradeoffs and figuring out the ideal balance.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    A successful implementation of multidimensional gas can greatly reduce certain "worst-case" resource usages, and thus reduce pressure on the need to optimize performance in order to support eg. STARKed hash-based binary trees. Having a hard target for state size growth would make it much easier for client developers to plan and estimate their requirements going forward into the future.

    As described above, EOF makes more extreme versions of multidimensional gas significantly easier to implement due to its gas non-observability properties.


    Verifiable delay functions (VDFs)
    What problem does it solve?
    Today, Ethereum uses RANDAO-based randomness to choose proposers. RANDAO-based randomness works by asking each proposer to reveal a secret that they committed to ahead of time, and mixing each revealed secret into the randomness. Each proposer thus has "1 bit of manipulation": they can change the randomness (at a cost) by not showing up. This is reasonably okay for finding proposers, because it's very rare that you can give yourself two new proposal opportunities by giving up one. But it's not okay for on-chain applications that need randomness. Ideally, we would find a more robust source of randomness.

    What is it, and how does it work?
    Verifiable delay functions are a type of function that can only be computed sequentially, with no speedups from parallelization. A simple example is repeated hashing: compute for i in range(10**9): x = hash(x). The output, proven with a SNARK proof of correctness, could be used as a random value. The idea is that the input is selected based on information available at time T, and the output is not yet known at time T: it only becomes available some time after T, once someone fully runs the computation. Because anyone can run the computation, there is no possibility to withhold the result, and so there is no ability to manipulate the outcome.

    The main risk to a verifiable delay function is unexpected optimization: someone figures out how to run the function much faster than expected, allowing them to manipulate the information they reveal at time T based on the future output. Unexpected optimization can happen in two ways:

    Hardware acceleration: someone makes an ASIC that runs the computation loop much faster than existing hardware.
    Unexpected parallelization: someone finds a way to run the function faster by parallelizing it, even if doing so requires 100x more resources.
    The tasks of creating a successful VDF is to avoid these two issues, while at the same time keeping efficiency practical (eg. one problem with the hash-based approach is that SNARK-proving over hashing in real time has heavy hardware requirements). Hardware acceleration is typically solved by having a public-good actor create and distribute reasonably-close-to-optimal ASICs for the VDF by itself.

    Attacks against MinRoot, a proposed VDF: https://inria.hal.science/hal-04320126/file/minrootanalysis2023.pdf
    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    Currently, there is no VDF construction that fully satisfies Ethereum researchers on all axes. More work is left to find such a function. If we have it, the main tradeoff is simply whether or not to include it: a simple tradeoff of functionality versus protocol complexity and risk to security. If we think a VDF is secure, but it ends up being insecure, then depending on how it's implemented security degrades to either the RANDAO assumption (1 bit of manipulation per attacker) or something slightly worse. Hence, even a broken VDF would not break the protocol, though it would break applications or any new protocol features that strongly depend on it.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    The VDF is a relatively self-contained ingredient of the Ethereum protocol, though in addition to increasing the security of proposer selection it also has uses in (i) onchain applications that depend on randomness, and potentially (ii) encrypted mempools, though making encrypted mempools based on a VDF still depends on additional cryptographic discoveries which have not yet happened.

    One point to keep in mind is that given uncertainty in hardware, there will be some "slack" between when a VDF output is produced and when it becomes needed. This means that information will be accessible a few blocks ahead. This can be an acceptable cost, but should be taken into account in eg. single-slot finality or committee selection designs.

    Obfuscation and one-shot signatures: the far future of cryptography
    What problem does it solve?
    One of Nick Szabo's most famous posts is a 1997 essay on "God protocols". In this essay, he points out that often, multi-party applications depend on a "trusted third party" to manage the interaction. The role of cryptography, in his view, is to create a simulated trusted third party that does the same job, without actually requiring any trust in any specific actor.

    "Mathematically trustworthy protocol", diagram by Nick Szabo

    So far, we have only been able to partially approach this ideal. If all we need is a transparent virtual computer, where the data and computation cannot be shut down, censored or tampered with, but privacy is not a goal, then blockchains can do it, though with limited scalability. If privacy is a goal, then up until recently we have only been able to make a few specific protocols for specific applications: digital signatures for basic authentication, ring signatures and linkable ring signatures for primitive forms of anonymity, identity-based encryption to enable more convenient encryption under specific assumptions about a trusted issuer, blind signatures for Chaumian e-cash, and so on. This approach requires lots of work for every new application.

    In the 2010s, we saw the first glimpse of a different, and more powerful approach, based on programmable cryptography. Instead of creating a new protocol for each new application, we could use powerful new protocols - specifically, ZK-SNARKs - to add cryptographic guarantees to arbitrary programs. ZK-SNARKs allow a user to prove any arbitrary statement about data that they hold, in a way that the proof (i) is easy to verify, and (ii) does not leak any data other than the statement itself. This was a huge step forward for privacy and scalability at the same time, that I have likened to the effect of transformers in AI. Thousands of man-years of application-specific work were suddenly swept away by a general-purpose solution that you can just plug in to solve a surprisingly wide range of problems.

    But ZK-SNARKs are only the first in a trio of similar extremely powerful general-purpose primitives. These protocols are so powerful that when I think of them, they remind me of a set of extremely powerful cards in Yu-Gi-Oh, a card game and a TV show that I used to play and watch when I was a young child: the Egyptian god cards. The Egyptian god cards are a trio of extremely powerful cards, which according to legend are potentially deadly to manufacture, and are so powerful that they are not allowed in duels. Similarly, in cryptography, we have the trio of Egyptian god protocols:

    What is it, and how does it work?
    ZK-SNARKs are one of these three protocols that we already have, to a high level of maturity. After large improvements to prover speed and developer-friendliness in the last five years, ZK-SNARKs have become the bedrock of Ethereum's scalability and privacy strategy. But ZK-SNARKs have an important limitation: you need to know the data to make proofs about it. Each piece of state in a ZK-SNARK application must have a single "owner", who must be around to approve any reads or writes to it.

    The second protocol, which does not have this limitation, is fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). FHE lets you do any computation on encrypted data without seeing the data. This lets you do computations on a user's data for the user's benefit while keeping the data and the algorithm private. It also lets you extend voting systems such as MACI to have almost-perfect security and privacy guarantees. FHE was for a long time considered too inefficient for practical use, but now it's finally becoming efficient enough that we are starting to see applications.

    Cursive, an application that uses two-party computation and FHE to do privacy-preserving discovery of common interests.

    But FHE too has its limits: any FHE-based technology still requires someone to hold the decryption key. This could be a M-of-N distributed setup, and you can even use TEEs to add a second layer of defense, but it's still a limitation.

    This gets us to the third protocol, which is more powerful than the other two combined: indistinguishability obfuscation. While it's still very far from maturity, as of 2020 we have theoretically valid protocols for it based on standard security assumptions, and work is recently starting on implementations. Indistinguishability obfuscation lets you create an "encrypted program" that performs an arbitrary computation, in such a way that all internal details of the program are hidden. As a simple example, you can put a private key into an obfuscated program which only lets you use it to sign prime numbers, and distribute this program to other people. They can use the program to sign any prime number, but cannot take the key out. But it's far more powerful than that: together with hashes, it can be used to implement any other cryptographic primitive, and more.

    The only thing that an obfuscated program can't do, is prevent itself from being copied. But for that, there is something even more powerful on the horizon, though it depends on everyone having quantum computers: quantum one-shot signatures.

    With obfuscation and one-shot signatures together, we can build almost perfect trustless third parties. The only thing we can't do with cryptography alone, and that we would still need a blockchain for, is guaranteeing censorship resistance. These technologies would allow us to not only make Ethereum itself much more secure, but also build much more powerful applications on top of it.

    To see how each of these primitives adds additional power, let us go through a key example: voting. Voting is a fascinating problem because it has so many tricky security properties that need to be satisfied, including very strong forms of both verifiability and privacy. While voting protocols with strong security properties have existed for decades, let us make the problem harder for ourselves by saying that we want a design that can handle arbitrary voting protocols: quadratic voting, pairwise-bounded quadratic funding, cluster-matching quadratic funding, and so on. That is, we want the "tallying" step to be an arbitrary program.

    First, suppose we put votes publicly on a blockchain. This gets us public verifiability (anyone can verify that the final outcome is correct, including tallying rules and eligibility rules) and censorship resistance (can't stop people from voting). But we have no privacy.
    Then, we add ZK-SNARKs. Now, we have privacy: each vote is anonymous, while ensuring that only authorized voters can vote, and every voter can only vote once.
    Now, we add the MACI mechanism. Votes are encrypted to a central server's decryption key. The central server is required to run the tallying process, including throwing out duplicate votes, and it publishes a ZK-SNARK proving the answer. This keeps the previous guarantees (even if the server is cheating!), but if the server is honest it adds a coercion-resistance guarantee: a user can't prove how they voted, even if they want to. This is because while a user can prove the vote that they made, they have no way to prove that they did not make another vote that cancels it out. This prevents bribery and other attacks.
    We run the tallying inside FHE, and then have an N/2-of-N threshold-decryption computation decrypt it. This makes the coercion-resistance guarantee N/2-of-N, instead of 1-of-1.
    We make the tallying program obfuscated, and we design the obfuscated program so that it can only give an output if given permission to do so, either by a proof of blockchain consensus, or by some quantity of proof of work, or both. This makes the coercion-resistance guarantee almost perfect: in the blockchain consensus case, you would need 51% of validators to collude to break it, and in the proof of work case, even if everyone colludes, re-running the tally with different subsets of voters to try to extract the behavior of a single voter would be extremely expensive. We can even make the program make a small random adjustment to the final tally, to make it even harder to extract the behavior of an individual voter.
    We add one-shot signatures, a primitive that depends on quantum computing that allows signatures that can only be used to sign a message of a certain type once. This makes the coercion-resistance guarantee truly perfect.
    Indistinguishability obfuscation also allows for other powerful applications. For example:

    DAOs, on-chain auctions, and other applications with arbitrary internal secret state.
    A truly universal trusted setup: someone can create an obfuscated program that contains a key, and can run any program and provide the output, putting hash(key, program) in as an input into the program. Given such a program, anyone can also put the program into itself, combining the program's pre-existing key with their own key, and in doing so extend the setup. This can be used to generate a 1-of-N trusted setup for any protocol.
    ZK-SNARKs whose verification is just a signature. Implementing this is simple: have a trusted setup where someone creates an obfuscated program that only signs a message with a key if it's a valid ZK-SNARK.
    Encrypted mempools. It becomes trivially easy to encrypt transactions in such a way that they only get decrypted when some onchain event in the future happens. This could even include the successful execution of a VDF.
    With one-shot signatures, we can make blockchains immune to finality-reverting 51% attacks, though censorship attacks continue to be possible. Primitives similar to one-shot signatures enable quantum money, solving the double-spend problem without a blockchain, though many more complex applications would still require a chain.

    If these primitives can be made efficient enough, then most applications in the world can be made decentralized. The main bottleneck would be verifying the correctness of implementations.

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    There is a heck of a lot left to do. Indistinguishability obfuscation is incredibly immature, and candidate constructions are millions of times too slow (if not more) to be usable in applications. Indistinguishability obfuscation is famous for having runtimes that are "theoretically" polynomial-time, but take longer than the lifetime of the universe to run in practice. More recent protocols have made runtimes less extreme, but the overhead is still far too high for regular use: one implementer expects a runtime of one year.

    Quantum computers do not even exist: all constructions you might read about on the internet today are either prototypes not capable of doing any computation larger than 4 bits, or are not real quantum computers, in the sense that while they may have quantum parts in them, they cannot run actually-meaningful computations like Shor's algorithm or Grover's algorithm. Recently, there have been signs that "real" quantum computers are no longer that far away. However, even if "real" quantum computers come soon, the day when regular people have quantum computers on their laptops or phones may well be decades after the day when powerful institutions get one that can crack elliptic curve cryptography.

    For indistinguishability obfuscation, one key tradeoff is in security assumptions. There are more aggressive designs that use exotic assumptions. These often have more realistic runtimes, but the exotic assumptions sometimes end up broken. Over time, we may end up understanding lattices enough to make assumptions that do not get broken. However, this path is more risky. The more conservative path is to insist on protocols whose security provably reduces to "standard" assumptions, but this may mean that it takes much longer until we get protocols that run fast enough.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    Extremely powerful cryptography could change the game completely. For example:

    If we get ZK-SNARKs which are as easy to verify as a signature, we may not need any aggregation protocols; we can just verify onchain directly.
    One-shot signatures could imply much more secure proof-of-stake protocols.
    Many complicated privacy protocols could be replaced with "just" having a privacy-preserving EVM.
    Encrypted mempools become much easier to implement.
    At first, the benefits will come on the application layer, because the Ethereum L1 inherently needs to be conservative on security assumptions. However, even application-layer use alone could be game-changing, by as much as the advent of ZK-SNARKs has been.

    One of Ethereum's challenges is that by default, any blockchain protocol's bloat and complexity grows over time. This happens in two places:

    Historical data: any transaction made and any account created at any point in history needs to be stored by all clients forever, and downloaded by any new clients making a full sync to the network. This causes client load and sync time to keep increasing over time, even as the chain's capacity remains the same.
    Protocol features: it's much easier to add a new feature than to remove an old one, causing code complexity to increase over time.
    For Ethereum to sustain itself into the long term, we need a strong counter-pressure against both of these trends, reducing complexity and bloat over time. But at the same time, we need to preserve one of the key properties that make blockchains great: their permanence. You can put an NFT, a love note in transaction calldata, or a smart contract containing a million dollars onchain, go into a cave for ten years, come out and find it still there waiting for you to read and interact with. For dapps to feel comfortable going fully decentralized and removing their upgrade keys, they need to be confident that their dependencies are not going to upgrade in a way that breaks them - especially the L1 itself.

    The Purge, 2023 roadmap.Balancing between these two needs, and minimizing or reversing bloat, complexity and decay while preserving continuity, is absolutely possible if we put our minds to it. Living organisms can do it: while most age over time, a lucky few do not. Even social systems can have extreme longevity. On a few occasions, Ethereum has already shown successes: proof of work is gone, the SELFDESTRUCT opcode is mostly gone, and beacon chain nodes already store old data up to only six months. Figuring out this path for Ethereum in a more generalized way, and moving toward an eventual outcome that is stable for the long term, is the ultimate challenge of Ethereum's long term scalability, technical sustainability and even security.


    The Purge: key goals
    Reducing client storage requirements by reducing or removing the need for every node to permanently store all history, and perhaps eventually even state
    Reducing protocol complexity by eliminating unneeded features
    In this chapter
    History expiry
    State expiry
    Feature cleanup

    History expiry
    What problem does it solve?
    As of the time of this writing, a full-synced Ethereum node requires roughly 1.1 terabytes of disk space for the execution client, plus another few hundred gigabytes for the consensus client. The great majority of this is history: data about historical blocks, transactions and receipts, the bulk of which are many years old. This means that the size of a node keeps increasing by hundreds of gigabytes each year, even if the gas limit does not increase at all.

    What is it, and how does it work?
    A key simplifying feature of the history storage problem is that because each block points to the previous block via a hash link (and other structures), having consensus on the present is enough to have consensus on history. As long as the network has consensus on the latest block, any historical block or transaction or state (account balance, nonce, code, storage) can be provided by any single actor along with a Merkle proof, and the proof allows anyone else to verify its correctness. While consensus is an N/2-of-N trust model, history is a 1-of-N trust model.

    This opens up a lot of options for how we can store the history. One natural option is a network where each node only stores a small percentage of the data. This is how torrent networks have worked for decades: while the network altogether stores and distributes millions of files, each participant only stores and distributes a few of them. Perhaps counterintuitively, this approach does not even necessarily decrease the robustness of the data. If, by making node running more affordable, we can get to a network with 100,000 nodes, where each node stores a random 10% of the history, then each piece of data would get replicated 10,000 times - exactly the same replication factor as a 10,000-node network where each node stores everything.

    Today, Ethereum has already started to move away from the model of all nodes storing all history forever. Consensus blocks (ie. the parts related to proof of stake consensus) are only stored for ~6 months. Blobs are only stored for ~18 days. EIP-4444 aims to introduce a one-year storage period for historical blocks and receipts. A long-term goal is to have a harmonized period (which could be ~18 days) during which each node is responsible for storing everything, and then have a peer-to-peer network made up of Ethereum nodes storing older data in a distributed way.Erasure codes can be used to increase robustness while keeping the replication factor the same. In fact, blobs already come erasure-coded in order to support data availability sampling. The simplest solution may well be to re-use this erasure coding, and put execution and consensus block data into blobs as well.

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    The main remaining work involves building out and integrating a concrete distributed solution for storing history - at least execution history, but ultimately also consensus and blobs. The easiest solutions for this are (i) to simply introduce an existing torrent library, and (ii) an Ethereum-native solution called the Portal network. Once either of these is introduced, we can turn EIP-4444 on. EIP-4444 itself does not require a hard fork, though it does require a new network protocol version. For this reason, there is value in enabling it for all clients at the same time, because otherwise there are risks of clients malfunctioning from connecting to other nodes expecting to download the full history but not actually getting it.

    The main tradeoff involves how hard we try to make "ancient" historical data available. The easiest solution would be to simply stop storing ancient history tomorrow, and rely on existing archive nodes and various centralized providers for replication. This is easy, but this weakens Ethereum's position as a place to make permanent records. The harder, but safer, path is to first build out and integrate the torrent network for storing history in a distributed way. Here, there are two dimensions of "how hard we try":

    How hard do we try to make sure that a maximally large set of nodes really is storing all the data?
    How deeply do we integrate the historical storage into the protocol?
    A maximally paranoid approach for (1) would involve proof of custody: actually requiring each proof of stake validator to store some percentage of history, and regularly cryptographically checking that they do so. A more moderate approach is to set a voluntary standard for what percentage of history each client stores.

    For (2), a basic implementation involves just taking the work that is already done today: Portal already stores ERA files containing the entire Ethereum history. A more thorough implementation would involve actually hooking this up to the syncing process, so that if someone wanted to sync a full-history-storing node or an archive node, they could do so even if no other archive nodes existed online, by syncing straight from the Portal network.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    Reducing history storage requirements is arguably even more important than statelessness if we want to make it extremely easy to run or spin up a node: out of the 1.1 TB that a node needs to have, ~300 GB is state, and the remaining ~800 GB is history. The vision of an Ethereum node running on a smart watch and taking only a few minutes to set up is only achievable if both statelessness and EIP-4444 are implemented.

    Limiting history storage also makes it more viable for newer Ethereum node implementations to only support recent versions of the protocol, which allows them to be much simpler. For example, many lines of code can be safely removed now that empty storage slots created during the 2016 DoS attacks have all been removed. Now that the switch to proof of stake is ancient history, clients can safely remove all proof-of-work-related code.


    State expiry
    What problem does it solve?
    Even if we remove the need for clients to store history, a client's storage requirement will continue to grow, by around 50 GB per year, because of ongoing growth to the state: account balances and nonces, contract code and contract storage. Users are able to pay a one-time cost to impose a burden on present and future Ethereum clients forever.

    State is much harder to "expire" than history, because the EVM is fundamentally designed around an assumption that once a state object is created, it will always be there and can be read by any transaction at any time. If we introduce statelessness, there is an argument that maybe this problem is not that bad: only a specialized class of block builders would need to actually store the state, and all other nodes (even inclusion list production!) can run statelessly. However, there is an argument that we don't want to lean on statelessness too much, and eventually we may want to expire state to keep Ethereum decentralized.

    What is it, and how does it work?
    Today, when you create a new state object (which can happen in one of three ways: (i) sending ETH to a new account, (ii) creating a new account with code, (iii) setting a previously-untouched storage slot), that state object is in the state forever. What we want instead, is for objects to automatically expire over time. The key challenge is doing this in a way that accomplishes three goals:

    Efficiency: don't require huge amounts of extra computation to run the expiry process
    User-friendliness: if someone goes into a cave for five years and comes back, they should not lose access to their ETH, ERC20s, NFTs, CDP positions...
    Developer-friendliness: developers should not have to switch to a completely unfamiliar mental model. Additionally, applications that are ossified today and do not update should continue to work reasonably well.
    It's easy to solve the problem without satisfying these goals. For example, you could have each state object also store a counter for its expiry date (which could be extended by burning ETH, which could happen automatically any time it's read or written), and have a process that loops through the state to remove expired state objects. However, this introduces extra computation (and even storage requirements), and it definitely does not satisfy the user-friendliness requirement. Developers too would have a hard time reasoning about edge cases involving storage values sometimes resetting to zero. If you make the expiry timer contract-wide, this makes life technically easier for developers, but it makes the economics harder: developers would have to think about how to "pass through" the ongoing costs of storage to their users.

    These are problems that the Ethereum core development community struggled with for many years, including proposals like "blockchain rent" and "regenesis". Eventually, we combined the best parts of the proposals and converged on two categories of "known least bad solutions":

    Partial state-expiry solutions
    Address-period-based state expiry proposals.
    Partial state expiry
    Partial state expiry proposals all work along the same principle. We split the state into chunks. Everyone permanently stores the "top-level map" of which chunks are empty or nonempty. The data within each chunk is only stored if that data has been recently accessed. There is a "resurrection" mechanism where if a chunk is no longer stored, anyone can bring that data back by providing a proof of what the data was.

    The main distinctions between these proposals are: (i) how do we define "recently", and (ii) how do we define "chunk"? One concrete proposal is EIP-7736, which builds upon the "stem-and-leaf" design introduced for Verkle trees (though compatible with any form of statelessness, eg. binary trees). In this design, header, code and storage slots that are adjacent to each other are stored under the same "stem". The data stored under a stem can be at most 256 * 31 = 7,936 bytes. In many cases, the entire header and code, and many key storage slots, of an account will all be stored under the same stem. If the data under a given stem is not read or written for 6 months, the data is no longer stored, and instead only a 32-byte commitment ("stub") to the data is stored. Future transactions that access that data would need to "resurrect" the data, with a proof that would be checked against the stub.There are other ways to implement a similar idea. For example, if account-level granularity is not enough, we could make a scheme where each 1/232 fraction of the tree is governed by a similar stem-and-leaf mechanism.

    This is trickier because of incentives: an attacker could force clients to permanently store a very large amount of state by putting a very large amount of data into a single subtree and sending a single transaction every year to "renew the tree". If you make the renewal cost proportional (or renewal duration inversely-proportional) to the tree size, then someone could grief another user by putting a very large amount of data into the same subtree as them. One could try to limit both problems by making the granularity dynamic based on the subtree size: for example, each consecutive 216 = 65536 state objects could be treated as a "group". However, these ideas are more complex; the stem-based approach is simple, and it aligns incentives, because typically all the data under a stem is related to the same application or user.

    Address-period-based state expiry proposals
    What if we wanted to avoid any permanent state growth at all, even 32-byte stubs? This is a hard problem because of resurrection conflicts: what if a state object gets removed, later EVM execution puts another state object in the exact same position, but then after that someone who cares about the original state object comes back and tries to recover it? With partial state expiry, the "stub" prevents new data from being created. With full state expiry, we cannot afford to store even the stub.

    The address-period-based design is the best known idea for solving this. Instead of having one state tree storing the whole state, we have a constantly growing list of state trees, and any state that gets read or written gets saved in the most recent state tree. A new empty state tree gets added once per period (think: 1 year). Older state trees are frozen solid. Full nodes are only expected to store the most recent two trees. If a state object was not touched for two periods and thus falls into an expired tree, it still can be read or written to, but the transaction would need to prove a Merkle proof for it - and once it does, a copy will be saved in the latest tree again.A key idea for making this all user and developer-friendly is the concept of address periods. An address period is a number that is part of an address. A key rule is that an address with address period N can only be read or written to during or after period N (ie. when the state tree list reaches length N). If you're saving a new state object (eg. a new contract, or a new ERC20 balance), if you make sure to put the state object into a contract whose address period is either N or N-1, then you can save it immediately, without needing to provide proofs that there was nothing there before. Any additions or edits to state in older address periods, on the other hand, do require a proof.

    This design preserves most of Ethereum's current properties, is very light on extra computation, allows applications to be written almost as they are today (ERC20s will need to rewrite, to ensure that balances of addresses with address period N are stored in a child contract which itself has address period N), and solves the "user goes into a cave for five years" problem. However, it has one big issue: addresses need to be expanded beyond 20 bytes to fit address periods.

    Address space extension
    One proposal is to introduce a new 32-byte address format, which includes a version number, an address period number and an expanded hash.

    0x01000000000157aE408398dF7E5f4552091A69125d5dFcb7B8C2659029395bdF
    The red is a version number. The four zeroes colored orange here are intended as empty space, which could fit a shard number in the future. The green is an address period number. The blue is a 26-byte hash.

    The key challenge here is backwards compatibility. Existing contracts are designed around 20 byte addresses, and often use tight byte-packing techniques that explicitly assume addresses are exactly 20 bytes long. One idea for solving this involves a translation map, where old-style contracts interacting with new-style addresses would see a 20-byte hash of the new-style address. However, there are significant complexities involved in making this safe.

    Address space contraction
    Another approach goes the opposite direction: we immediately forbid some 2128-sized sub-range of addresses (eg. all addresses starting with 0xffffffff), and then use that range to introduce addresses with address periods and 14-byte hashes.

    0xffffffff000169125d5dFcb7B8C2659029395bdF
    The key sacrifice that this approach makes, is that it introduces security risks for counterfactual addresses: addresses that hold assets or permissions, but whose code has not yet been published to chain. The risk involves someone creating an address which claims to have one piece of (not-yet-published) code, but also has another valid piece of code which hashes to the same address. Computing such a collision requires 280 hashes today; address space contraction would reduce this number to a very accessible 256 hashes.

    The key risk area, counterfactual addresses that are not wallets held by a single owner, is a relatively rare case today, but is likely to become more common as we enter a multi-L2 world. The only solution is to simply accept this risk, but identify all common use cases where this may be an issue, and come up with effective workarounds.

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    I see four viable paths for the future:

    We do statelessness, and never introduce state expiry. State is ever-growing (albeit slowly: we may not see it exceed 8 TB for decades), but only needs to be held by a relatively specialized class of users: not even PoS validators would need the state.

    The one function that needs access to parts of the state is inclusion list production, but we can accomplish this in a decentralized way: each user is responsible for maintaining the portion of the state tree that contains their own accounts. When they broadcast a transaction, they broadcast it with a proof of the state objects accessed during the verification step (this works for both EOAs and ERC-4337 accounts). Stateless validators can then combine these proofs into a proof for the whole inclusion list.
    We do partial state expiry, and accept a much lower but still nonzero rate of permanent state size growth. This outcome is arguably similar to how history expiry proposals involving peer-to-peer networks accept a much lower but still nonzero rate of permanent history storage growth from each client having to store a low but fixed percentage of the historical data.
    We do state expiry, with address space expansion. This will involve a multi-year process of making sure that the address format conversion approach works and is safe, including for existing applications.
    We do state expiry, with address space contraction. This will involve a multi-year process of making sure that all of the security risks involving address collisions, including cross-chain situations, are handled.
    One important point is that the difficult issues around address space expansion and contraction will eventually have to be addressed regardless of whether or not state expiry schemes that depend on address format changes are ever implemented. Today, it takes roughly 280 hashes to generate an address collision, a computational load that is already feasible for extremely well-resourced actors: a GPU can do around 227 hashes, so running for a year it can compute 252, so all ~230 GPUs in the world could compute a collision in ~1/4 of a year, and FPGAs and ASICs could accelerate this further. In the future, such attacks will become open to more and more people. Hence, the actual cost of implementing full state expiry may not be as high as it seems, since we have to solve this very challenging address problem regardless.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    Doing state expiry potentially makes transitions from one state tree format to another easier, because there will be no need for a transition procedure: you could simply start making new trees using a new format, and then later do a hard fork to convert the older trees. Hence, while state expiry is complex, it does have benefits in simplifying other aspects of the roadmap.


    Feature cleanup
    What problems does it solve?
    One of the key preconditions of security, accessibility and credible neutrality is simplicity. If a protocol is beautiful and simple, it reduces the chance that there will be bugs. It increases the chance that new developers will be able to come in and work with any part of it. It's more likely to be fair and easier to defend against special interests. Unfortunately, protocols, like any social system, by default become more complex over time. If we do not want Ethereum to go into a black hole of ever-increasing complexity, we need to do one of two things: (i) stop making changes and ossify the protocol, (ii) be able to actually remove features and reduce complexity. An intermediate route, of making fewer changes to the protocol, and also removing at least a little complexity over time, is also possible. This section will talk how we can reduce or remove complexity.

    What is it, and how does it work?
    There is no big single fix that can reduce protocol complexity; the inherent nature of the problem is that there are many little fixes.

    One example that is mostly finished already, and can serve as a blueprint for how to handle the others, is the removal of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode. The SELFDESTRUCT opcode was the only opcode that could modify an unlimited number of storage slots within a single block, requiring clients to implement significantly more complexity to avoid DoS attacks. The opcode's original purpose was to enable voluntary state clearing, allowing the state size to decrease over time. In practice, very few ended up using it. The opcode was nerfed to only allow self-destructing accounts created in the same transaction in the Dencun hardfork. This solves the DoS issue and allows for significant simplification in client code. In the future, it likely makes sense to eventually remove the opcode completely.

    Some key examples of protocol simplification opportunities that have been identified so far include the following. First, some examples that are outside the EVM; these are relatively non-invasive, and thus easier to get consensus on and implement in a shorter timeframe.

    RLP ‚Üí SSZ transition: originally, Ethereum objects were serialized using an encoding called RLP. RLP is untyped, and needlessly complex. Today, the beacon chain uses SSZ, which is significantly better in many ways, including supporting not just serialization but also hashing. Eventually, we want to get rid of RLP entirely, and move all data types into being SSZ structs, which would in turn make upgradability much easier. Current EIPs for this include [1] [2] [3].
    Removal of old transaction types: there are too many transaction types today, many of them could potentially be removed. A more moderate alternative to full removal is an account abstraction feature by which smart accounts could include the code to process and verify old-style transactions if they so choose.
    LOG reform: logs create bloom filters and other logic that adds complexity to the protocol, but is not actually used by clients because it is too slow. We could remove these features, and instead put effort into alternatives, such as extra-protocol decentralized log reading tools that use modern technology like SNARKs.
    Eventual removal of the beacon chain sync committee mechanism: the sync committee mechanism was originally introduced to enable light client verification of Ethereum. However, it adds significant complexity to the protocol. Eventually, we will be able to verify the Ethereum consensus layer directly using SNARKs, which would remove the need for a dedicated light client verification protocol. Potentially, changes to consensus could enable us to remove sync committees even earlier, by creating a more "native" light client protocol that involves verifying signatures from a random subset of the Ethereum consensus validators.
    Data format harmonization: today, execution state is stored in a Merkle Patricia tree, consensus state is stored in an SSZ tree, and blobs are committed to with KZG commitments. In the future, it makes sense to make a single unified format for block data and a single unified format for state. These formats would cover all important needs: (i) easy proofs for stateless clients, (ii) serialization and erasure coding for data, (iii) standardized data structures.
    Removal of beacon chain committees: this mechanism was originally introduced to support a particular version of execution sharding. Instead, we ended up doing sharding through L2s and blobs. Hence, committees are unnecessary, and so there is an in-progress move toward removing them.
    Removal of mixed-endianness: the EVM is big-endian and the consensus layer is little-endian. It may make sense to re-harmonize and make everything one or the other (likely big-endian, because the EVM is harder to change)
    Now, some examples that are inside the EVM:

    Simplification of gas mechanics: the current gas rules are not quite well-optimized to give clear limits to the quantity of resources required to verify a block. Key examples of this include (i) storage read/write costs, which are meant to bound the number of reads/writes in a block but are currently pretty haphazard, and (ii) memory filling rules, where it is currently hard to estimate the max memory consumption of the EVM. Proposed fixes include statelessness gas cost changes, which harmonize all storage-related costs into a simple formula, and this proposal for memory pricing.
    Removal of precompiles: many of the precompiles that Ethereum has today are both needlessly complex and relatively unused, and make up a large percentage of consensus failure near-misses while not actually being used by any applications. Two ways of dealing with this are (i) just removing the precompile, and (ii) replacing it with a (inevitably more expensive) piece of EVM code that implements the same logic. This draft EIP proposes to do this for the identity precompile as a first step; later on, RIPEMD160, MODEXP and BLAKE may be candidates for removal.
    Removal of gas observability: make the EVM execution no longer able to see how much gas it has left. This would break a few applications (most notably, sponsored transactions), but would enable much easier upgrading in the future (eg. for more advanced versions of multidimensional gas). The EOF spec already makes gas unobservable, though to be useful for protocol simplification EOF would need to become mandatory.
    Improvements to static analysis: today EVM code is difficult to statically analyze, particularly because jumps can be dynamic. This also makes it more difficult to make optimized EVM implementations that pre-compile EVM code into some other language. We can potentially fix this by removing dynamic jumps (or making them much more expensive, eg. gas cost linear in the total number of JUMPDESTs in a contract). EOF does this, though getting protocol simplification gains out of this would require making EOF mandatory.

    The main tradeoff in doing this kind of feature simplification is (i) how much we simplify and how quickly vs (ii) backwards compatibility. Ethereum's value as a chain comes from it being a platform where you can deploy an application and be confident that it will still work many years from now. At the same time, it's possible to take that ideal too far, and, to paraphrase William Jennings Bryan, "crucify Ethereum on a cross of backwards compatibility". If there are only two applications in all of Ethereum that use a given feature, and one has had zero users for years and the other is almost completely unused and secures a total of $57 of value, then we should just remove the feature, and if needed pay the victims $57 out of pocket.

    The broader social problem is in creating a standardized pipeline for making non-emergency backwards-compatibility-breaking changes. One way to approach this is to examine and extend existing precedents, such as the SELFDESTRUCT process. The pipeline looks something as follows:

    Step 1: start talking about removing feature X
    Step 2: do analysis to identify how much removing X breaks applications, depending on the results either (i) abandon the idea, (ii) proceed as planned, or (iii) identify a modified "least-disruptive" way to remove X and proceed with that
    Step 3: make a formal EIP to deprecate X. Make sure that popular higher-level infrastructure (eg. programming languages, wallets) respect this and stop using that feature.
    Step 4: finally, actually remove X
    There should be a multi-year-long pipeline between step 1 and step 4, with clear information about which items are at which step. At that point, there is a tradeoff between how vigorous and fast the feature-removal pipeline is, versus being more conservative and putting more resources into other areas of protocol development, but we are still far from the Pareto frontier.

    EOF
    A major set of changes that has been proposed to the EVM is the EVM Object Format (EOF). EOF introduces a large number of changes, such as banning gas observability, code observability (ie. no CODECOPY), allowing static jumps only. The goal is to allow the EVM to be upgraded more, in a way that has stronger properties, while preserving backwards compatibility (as the pre-EOF EVM will still exist).

    This has the advantage that it creates a natural path to adding new EVM features and encouraging migration to a more restrictive EVM with stronger guarantees. It has the disadvantage that it significantly increases protocol complexity, unless we can find a way to eventually deprecate and remove the old EVM. One major question is: what role does EOF play in EVM simplification proposals, especially if the goal is to reduce the complexity of the EVM as a whole?

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    Many of the "improvement" proposals in the rest of the roadmap are also opportunities to do simplifications of old features. To repeat some examples from above:

    Switching to single-slot finality gives us an opportunity to remove committees, rework economics, and do other proof-of-stake-related simplifications.
    Fully implementing account abstraction lets us remove a lot of existing transaction-handling logic, by moving it into a piece of "default account EVM code" that all EOAs could be replaced by.
    If we move the Ethereum state to binary hash trees, this could be harmonized with a new version of SSZ, so that all Ethereum data structures could be hashed in the same way.
    A more radical approach: turn big parts of the protocol into contract code
    A more radical Ethereum simplification strategy is to keep the protocol as is, but move large parts of it from being protocol features to being contract code.

    The most extreme version of this would be to make the Ethereum L1 "technically" be just the beacon chain, and introduce a minimal VM (eg. RISC-V, Cairo, or something even more minimal specialized for proving systems) which allows anyone else to create their own rollup. The EVM would then turn into the first one of these rollups. This is ironically exactly the same outcome as the execution environment proposals from 2019-20, though SNARKs make it significantly more viable to actually implement.A more moderate approach would be to keep the relationship between the beacon chain and the current Ethereum execution environment as-is, but do an in-place swap of the EVM. We could choose RISC-V, Cairo or another VM to be the new "official Ethereum VM", and then force-convert all EVM contracts into new-VM code that interprets the logic of the original code (by compiling or interpreting it). Theoretically, this could even be done with the "target VM" being a version of EOF.

    One of the most powerful things about a blockchain is the fact that anyone can run a node on their computer and verify that the chain is correct. Even if 95% of the nodes running the chain consensus (PoW, PoS...) all immediately agreed to change the rules, and started producing blocks according to the new rules, everyone running a fully-verifying node would refuse to accept the chain. The stakers who are not part of such a cabal would automatically converge on, and continue building, a chain that continues to follow the old rules, and fully-verifying users would follow that chain.

    This is a key difference between blockchains and centralized systems. However, for this property to hold, running a fully-verifying node needs to be actually feasible for a critical mass of people. This applies both to stakers (as if stakers are not verifying the chain, they are not actually contributing to enforcing the protocol rules), and to regular users. Today, running a node is possible on a consumer laptop (including the one being used to write this post), but doing so is difficult. The Verge is about changing this, and making fully-verifying the chain so computationally affordable that every mobile wallet, browser wallet, and even smart watch is doing it by default.

    The Verge, 2023 roadmap.


    Originally, the "Verge" referred to the idea of moving Ethereum state storage to Verkle trees - a tree structure that allows for much more compact proofs, enabling stateless validation of Ethereum blocks. A node could verify an Ethereum block without having any of the Ethereum state (account balances, contract code, storage...) on its hard drive, at a cost of spending a few hundred kilobytes of proof data and a few hundred extra milliseconds verifying a proof. Today, the Verge represents a much larger vision focused on enabling maximally resource-efficient verification of the Ethereum chain, which includes not just stateless validation technology, but also verifying all Ethereum execution with SNARKs.

    In addition to the added long-term focus on SNARK-verifying the whole chain, another new question has to do with whether or not Verkle trees are even the best technology in the first place. Verkle trees are vulnerable to quantum computers, and so if we replace the current KECCAK Merkle Patricia tree with Verkle trees, we will later have to replace the trees again. The natural alternative to Merkle trees is skipping straight to using a STARK of Merkle branches in a binary tree. Historically, this has been considered non-viable due to overhead and technical complexity. More recently, however, we have seen Polygon prove 1.7 million Poseidon hashes per second on a laptop with circle STARKs, and proving times for more "conventional" hashes are also rapidly improving thanks to techniques like GKR.

    As a result, over the past year the Verge has become much more open-ended, and there are several possibilities.

    Stateless verification: Verkle or STARKs
    What problem are we trying to solve?
    Today, an Ethereum client needs to store hundreds of gigabytes of state data in order to verify blocks, and this amount continues to increase with each passing year. The raw state data increases by ~30 GB per year, and individual clients have to store some extra data on top to be able to update the trie efficiently.This reduces the number of users who can run fully-verifying Ethereum nodes: even though hard drives large enough to store all Ethereum state and even history for many years are readily available, the computers that people buy by default tend to only have a few hundred gigabytes of storage. The state size also introduces a great friction into the process of setting up a node for the first time: the node needs to download the entire state, which can take hours or days. This has all kinds of knockon effects. For example, it makes it significantly harder for a staker to upgrade their staking setup. Technically, it's possible to do this with no downtime - start a new client, wait for it to sync, then shut down the old client and transfer the key - but in practice it's technically complicated.

    What is it and how does it work?
    Stateless verification is a technology that allows nodes to verify blocks without having the entire state. Instead, each block comes with a witness, which includes (i) the values (eg. code, balances, storage) at the specific locations in the state that the block will access, and (ii) a cryptographic proof that those values are correct.

    Actually implementing stateless verification requires changing the Ethereum state tree structure. This is because the current Merkle Patricia tree is extremely unfriendly to implementing any cryptographic proof scheme, especially in the worst case. This is true for both "raw" Merkle branches, and the possibility of "wrapping" the Merkle branches in a STARK. The key difficulties stem from two weaknesses of the MPT:

    It's a hexary tree (ie. each node has 16 children). This means that on average, a proof in a size-N tree has 32 * (16 - 1) * log16(N) = 120 * log2(N) bytes, or about 3840 bytes in a 232-item tree. With a binary tree, you only need 32 * (2 - 1) * log2(N) = 32 * log2(N) bytes, or about 1024 bytes.
    The code is not Merkelized. This means that proving any access of account code requires providing the entire code, which is a maximum of 24000 bytes.


    We can compute a worst-case scenario as follows:

    30,000,000 gas / 2,400 ("cold" account read cost) * (5 * 480 + 24,000) = 330,000,000 bytes

    The branch cost is slightly decreased ( 5 * 480 instead of 8 * 480 ) because the top parts of branches are repeated when there are many of them. But even still, this works out to a completely unrealistic amount of data to download within one slot. If we try to wrap it in a STARK, we get two problems: (i) KECCAK is relatively STARK-unfriendly, and (ii) 330 MB of data means we have to prove 5 million calls to the KECCAK round function, which is way too much to prove on all but the most powerful consumer hardware, even if we could make STARK-proving KECCAK much more efficient.

    If we just replace the hexary tree with a binary tree, and we additionally Merkelize code, then the worst case becomes roughly 30,000,000 / 2,400 * 32 * (32 - 14 + 8) = 10,400,000 bytes (the 14 is a subtraction for redundant bits of ~214 branches, and the 8 is the length of a proof going into a leaf in a chunk). Note that this requires a change in gas costs, to charge for accessing each individual chunk of code; EIP-4762 does this. 10.4 MB is much better, but it's still too much data for many nodes to download within one slot. And so we need to introduce some more powerful technology. For this, there are two leading solutions: Verkle trees, and STARKed binary hash trees.

    Verkle trees
    Verkle trees use elliptic curve-based vector commitments to make much shorter proofs. The key unlock is that the piece of the proof corresponding to each parent-child relationship is only 32 bytes, regardless of the width of the tree. The only limit to the width of the tree is that if the tree gets too wide, proofs become computationally inefficient. The implementation proposed for Ethereum has a width of 256.The size of a single branch in a proof thus becomes 32 * log256(N) = 4 * log2(N) bytes. The theoretical max proof size thus becomes roughly 30,000,000 / 2,400 * 32 * (32 - 14 + 8) / 8 = 1,300,000 bytes (the math works out slightly differently in practice because of uneven distribution of state chunks, but this is fine as a first approximation).

    As an additional caveat, note that in all of the above examples, this "worst case" is not quite a worst case: an even worse case is when an attacker intentionally "mines" two addresses to have a long common prefix in the tree and reads from one of them, which can extend the worst-case branch length by another ~2x. But even with this caveat, Verkle trees get us to ~2.6 MB worst-case proofs, which roughly matches today's worst-case calldata.

    We also take advantage of this caveat to do another thing: we make it very cheap to access "adjacent" storage: either many chunks of code of the same contract, or adjacent storage slots. EIP-4762 provides a definition of adjacency, and charges only 200 gas for adjacent access. With adjacent accesses, the worst-case proof size becomes 30,000,000 / 200 * 32 = 4,800,800 bytes, which is still roughly within tolerances. If we want this value decreased for safety, we can increase the adjacent access costs slightly.

    STARKed binary hash trees
    The technology here is very self-explanatory: you do a binary tree, take the max-10.4-MB proof that you need to prove the values in a block, and replace the proof with a STARK of the proof. This gets us to the point where the proof itself consists of only the data being proven, plus ~100-300 kB fixed overhead from the actual STARK.

    The main challenge here is prover time. We can make basically the same calculations as above, except instead of counting bytes, we count hashes. A 10.4 MB block means 330,000 hashes. If we add in the possibility of an attacker "mining" addresses with a long common prefix in the tree, the real worst case becomes around 660,000 hashes. So if we can prove ~200,000 hashes per second, we're fine.

    These numbers have already been reached on a consumer laptop with the Poseidon hash function, which has been explicitly designed for STARK-friendliness. However, Poseidon is relatively immature, and so many do not yet trust it for security. There are thus two realistic paths forward:

    Do lots and lots of security analysis on Poseidon quickly, and get comfortable enough with it to deploy it at L1
    Use a more "conservative" hash function, such as SHA256 or BLAKE
    Starkware's circle STARK provers at the time of this writing can only prove ~10-30k hashes per second on a consumer laptop if they are proving conservative hash functions. However, STARK technology is improving quickly. Even today, GKR-based techniques show promise in potentially increasing this to the ~100-200k range.

    Use cases of witnesses other than verifying blocks
    In addition to verifying blocks, there are three other key use cases for more efficient stateless validation:

    Mempools: when a transaction gets broadcasted, nodes in the p2p network need to verify that the transaction is valid before re-broadcasting it. Today, validation involves verifying the signature, but also checking that the balance is sufficient and the nonce is correct. In the future (eg. with native account abstraction, such as EIP-7701), this may involve running some EVM code, which does some state accesses. If nodes are stateless, the transaction will need to come with a proof proving the state objects.
    Inclusion lists: this is a proposed feature which allows (potentially small and unsophisticated) proof-of-stake validators to force the next block to contain a transaction, regardless of the (potentially large and sophisticated) block builder's wishes. This would reduce the ability of powerful actors to manipulate the blockchain by delaying transactions. However, this requires validators to have a way to verify the validity of transactions in the inclusion list.
    Light clients: if we want users accessing the chain through wallets (eg. Metamask, Rainbow, Rabby...) to do so without trusting centralized actors, they need to run light clients (eg. Helios). The core Helios module gives the user verified state roots. However, for a fully trustless experience, the user needs proofs for each individual RPC call they make (eg. for an eth_call request, the user would need a proof of all the state accessed during the call)
    One thing that all of these use cases have in common is that they require a fairly large number of proofs, but each proof is small. For this reason, STARK proofs do not actually make sense for them; instead, it's most realistic to just use Merkle branches directly. Another advantage of Merkle branches is that they are updateable: given a proof of a state object X, rooted in block B, if you receive a child block B2 with its witness, you can update the proof to make it rooted in block B2. Verkle proofs are also natively updateable.

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    The main remaining work to do is:

    More analysis on the consequences of EIP-4762 (statelessness gas cost changes)
    More work finalizing and testing the transition procedure, which is a large part of the complexity of any statelessness EIP
    More security analysis of Poseidon, Ajtai and other "STARK-friendly" hash functions
    More development of ultra-efficient STARK protocols for "conservative" (or "traditional") hash functions, eg. based on ideas from Binius or GKR.
    We also will soon have a decision point of which of three options to take: (i) Verkle trees, (ii) STARK-friendly hash functions, and (iii) conservative hash functions. Their properties can be approximately summarized in this table:

    Algorithm	Proof size	Security assumptions	Worst-case prover time (today)
    Verkle	Data plus ~100-2,000 kB	Elliptic curve (not quantum-resistant)	< 1s
    STARK over conservative hash functions (eg. SHA256, BLAKE)	Data plus ~100-300 kB	Conservative hash functions	> 10 s
    STARK over aggressive hash functions (Poseidon, Ajtai)	Data plus ~100-300 kB	Relatively new and less-tested hash functions	1-2s
    In addition to these "headline numbers", there are a few other important considerations:

    Today, the Verkle tree code is quite mature. Using anything but Verkle would realistically delay deployment, likely by one hard fork. This can be okay, especially if we need the extra time anyway to work on hash function analysis or prover implementations, and if we have other important features we want to get included in Ethereum earlier.
    Updating the state root is faster with hashes than with Verkle trees. This means that hash-based approaches can lead to lower sync time for full nodes.
    Verkle trees have interesting witness update properties - Verkle tree witnesses are updateable. This property is useful for mempools, inclusion lists, and other use cases, and it also can potentially help with making implementations more efficient: if a state object is updated, you can update the witness on the second last level without even reading the last level.
    Verkle trees are more difficult to SNARK-prove. If we want to reduce the proof size all the way to a few kilobytes, Verkle proofs introduce some difficulty. This is because the verification of a Verkle proof introduces a large number of 256-bit operations, which requires the proof system to either have a lot of overhead, or itself have a custom internal construction with a 256-bit part for the Verkle proof. This is not a problem for statelessness itself, but introduces more difficulties later.
    If we want the Verkle witness updateability properties in a way that's quantum-safe, and reasonably efficient, one other possible path is lattice-based Merkle trees.

    If proof systems end up being not efficient enough in the worst case, one other "rabbit out of a hat" that we could use to compensate for such an inadequacy is multidimensional gas: have separate gas limits for (i) calldata, (ii) computation, (iii) state accesses, and possibly other distinct resources. Multidimensional gas adds complexity, but in exchange it much more tightly bounds the ratio between average case and worst case. With multidimensional gas, the theoretical max number of branches to prove could plausibly decrease from 30,000,000 / 2400 = 12,500 to eg. 3000. This would make BLAKE3 (just barely) sufficient even today, with no further prover improvements.

    Multidimensional gas allows the resource limits of a block to much more closely replicate the resource limits of the underlying hardware.Another "rabbit out of a hat" is this proposal to delay state root computation until the slot after a block. This would give us a full 12 seconds to compute the state root, meaning that only ~60,000 hashes/sec proving time is sufficient even in the most extreme cases, again putting us in the range of BLAKE3 being just barely sufficient.

    This approach has the downside that it would increase light client latency by a slot, though there are more clever versions of the technique that reduce this delay to just the proof generation latency. For example, the proof could be broadcasted across the network as soon as any node generates it, instead of waiting for the next block.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    Solving statelessness greatly increases the ease of solo staking. This becomes much more valuable if technologies that reduce the minimum balance of solo staking, such as Orbit SSF or application-layer strategies like squad staking, become available.

    Multidimensional gas becomes easier if EOF is also introduced. This is because a key complexity of multidimensional gas for execution is handling sub-calls which don't pass along the parent call's full gas, and EOF makes this problem trivial by simply making such sub-calls illegal (and native account abstraction would provide an in-protocol alternative for the current primary use case of partial-gas sub-calls).

    One other important synergy is between stateless validation and history expiry. Today, clients have to store nearly a terabyte of history data; this data is several times larger than the state. Even if clients are stateless, the dream of nearly-storage-free clients will not be realized unless we can relieve clients of the responsibility to store history as well. The first step in this regard is EIP-4444, which also implies storing historical data in torrents or the Portal network.


    Validity proofs of EVM execution
    What problem are we trying to solve?
    The long-term goal for Ethereum block verification is clear: you should be able to verify an Ethereum block by (i) downloading the block, or perhaps even only small parts of the block with data availability sampling, and (ii) verifying a small proof that the block is valid. This would be an extremely low-resource operation, and could be done on a mobile client, inside a browser wallet, or even (without the data availability part) in another chain.

    Getting to this point requires having SNARK or STARK proofs of (i) the consensus layer (ie. the proof of stake), and (ii) the execution layer (ie. the EVM). The former is itself a challenge, and it should be addressed during the process of making further ongoing improvements to the consensus layer (eg. for single slot finality). The latter requires proofs of EVM execution.

    What is it and how does it work?
    Formally, in the Ethereum specifications, the EVM is defined as a state transition function: you have some pre-state S, a block B, and you are computing a post-state S' = STF(S, B). If a user is using a light client, they do not have S and S' or even B in their entirety; instead, they have a pre-state root R, and a post-state root R' and a block hash H. The full statement that needs to be proven is approximately:

    Public inputs: pre-state root R, post-state root R' , block hash H
    Private inputs: block body B , the objects in the state accessed by the block Q, the same objects after executing the block Q' , the state proof (eg. Merkle branches) P
    Claim 1: P is a valid proof that Q contains some portion of the state represented by R
    Claim 2: if you run STF on Q , (i) the execution only accesses objects inside of Q, (ii) the block is valid, and (iii) the outcome is Q'
    Claim 3: If you recompute the new state root, using information from Q' and P , you get R'
    If this exists, you can have a light client that fully verifies the Ethereum EVM execution. This allows clients to be quite low-resource already. To get to true fully-verifying Ethereum clients, you also need to do the same for the consensus side.

    Implementations of validity proofs for EVM computation already exist, and are being used heavily by layer 2s. However, there is still a lot to do to make EVM validity proofs viable for L1.

    What are some links to existing research?
    EF PSE ZK-EVM (now sunsetted because better options exist): https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits
    Zeth, which works by compiling the EVM into the RISC-0 ZK-VM: https://github.com/risc0/zeth
    ZK-EVM formal verification project: https://verified-zkevm.org/
    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    Today, validity proofs for the EVM are inadequate in two dimensions: security and prover time.

    A secure validity proof involves having an assurance that the SNARK actually verifies the EVM computation, and does not have a bug in it. The two leading techniques for increasing security are multi-provers and formal verification. Multi-provers means having multiple independently-written validity proof implementations, much like there are multiple clients, and having clients accept a block if it's proven by a sufficiently large subset of these implementations. Formal verification involves using tools often used to prove mathematical theorems, such as Lean4, to prove that a validity proof only accepts inputs that are correct executions of the underlying EVM specification (eg. the EVM K Semantics or the Ethereum execution layer specifications (EELS) written in python).

    Sufficiently fast prover time means that any Ethereum block can be proven in less than ~4 seconds. Today, we are still far from this, though we are much closer than was imagined possible even two years ago. To get to this goal, we need to advance in three directions:

    Parallelization - the fastest EVM prover today can prove an average Ethereum block in ~15 seconds. It does this by parallelizing between several hundred GPUs, and then aggregating their work together at the end. Theoretically, we know exactly how to make an EVM prover that can prove computation in O(log(N)) time: have one GPU do each step, and then do an "aggregation tree":There are challenges in implementing this. To work even in worst-case situations, where a very large transaction takes up an entire block, the splitting of the computation cannot be per-tx; it must be per-opcode (of the EVM or of an underlying VM like RISC-V). A key implementation challenge that makes this not completely trivial is the need to make sure that the "memory" of the VM is consistent between different parts of the proof. However, if we can make this kind of recursive proof, then we know that at least the prover latency problem is solved, even without any improvements on any of the other axes.

    Proof system optimization - new proof systems like Orion, Binius, GKR, and many more, are likely to lead to yet another large reduction in prover time for general-purpose computation.

    EVM gas cost other changes - many things in the EVM could be optimized to be much more prover-friendly, especially in the worst case. Being able to prove an average Ethereum block in 4 seconds is not enough, if an attacker can construct a block that will clog up provers' time for ten minutes. The EVM changes required can largely be broken down into two categories:

    Gas cost changes - if an operation takes a long time to prove, it should have a high gas cost, even if it is relatively fast to compute. EIP-7667 is one proposed EIP to handle the worst offenders in this regard: it significantly increases the gas costs of (conventional) hash functions exposed as relatively cheap opcodes and precompiles. To compensate for these gas cost increases, we can reduce the gas cost of EVM opcodes that are relatively cheap to prove, so as to keep average throughput the same.
    Data structure replacements - in addition to replacing the state tree with a more STARK-friendly alternative, we need to replace the transaction list, receipt tree, and other structures that are expensive to prove. Etan Kissling's EIPs that move transaction and receipt structures to SSZ ([1] [2] [3]) are one step in that direction.
    In addition to this, the two "rabbits out of a hat" mentioned in the previous section (multidimensional gas, and delayed state root) can also help here. However, it's worth noting that unlike stateless validation, where using either rabbit out of a hat means that we have sufficient technology to do what we need today, even with these techniques full ZK-EVM validation will take more work - it will just take less work.

    One thing that was not mentioned above is prover hardware: using GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs to generate proofs faster. Fabric Cryptography, Cysic and Accseal are three companies pushing ahead on this. This will be extremely valuable for layer 2s, but it's unlikely to become a decisive consideration for layer 1, because there is a strong desire to keep layer 1 highly decentralized, which implies that proof generation must be within the capabilities of a reasonably large subset of Ethereum users, and should not be bottlenecked by a single company's hardware. Layer 2s can make more aggressive tradeoffs.

    More work remains to be done in each of these areas:

    Parallelized proving requires proof systems where different parts of the proof can "share a memory" (eg. lookup tables). We know techniques for doing this, but they need to be implemented.
    We need more analysis to figure out the ideal set of gas cost changes to minimize worst-case prover time.
    We need more work on proving systems
    Likely tradeoffs here include:

    Security vs prover time: it may be possible to cut down prover time using aggressive choices for hash functions, proof systems with more complexity or more aggressive security assumptions, or other design choices.
    Decentralization vs prover time: the community needs to agree on what is the "spec" for prover hardware that it is targeting. Is it okay to require provers to be large-scale entities? Do we want a high-end consumer laptop to be able to prove an Ethereum block in 4 seconds? Something in between?
    Degree of breaking backwards compatibility: insufficiencies in other areas can be compensated for by making much more aggressive gas cost changes, but this is more likely to disproportionately increase the cost of some applications over others, and force developers to rewrite and redeploy code in order to remain economically viable. Similarly, the "rabbits out of a hat" have their own complexity and downsides.
    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    The core tech needed to make EVM validity proofs at layer 1 happen is heavily shared with two other areas:

    Validity proofs at layer 2 (ie. "ZK rollups")
    The "STARK a binary hash proof" approach to statelessness
    A successful implementation of validity proofs at layer 1 allows for the ultimate in easy solo staking: even the weakest computer (including phone or smart watch) would be able to stake. This further increases the value of addressing the other limitations to solo staking (eg. the 32 ETH minimum).

    Additionally, EVM validity proofs at L1 can enable considerable L1 gas limit increases.


    Validity proofs of consensus
    What problem are we trying to solve?
    If we want it to be possible to fully verify an Ethereum block with a SNARK, then the EVM execution is not the only part we need to prove. We also need to prove the consensus: the part of the system that handles deposits, withdrawals, signatures, validator balance updates, and other elements of the proof-of-stake part of Ethereum.

    The consensus is considerably simpler than the EVM, but it has the challenge that we don't have layer 2 EVM rollups as a reason why most of the work is going to be done anyway. Hence, any implementation of proving Ethereum consensus would need to be done "from scratch", although the proof systems themselves, are shared work that can be built on top of.

    What is it and how does it work?
    The beacon chain is defined as a state transition function, just like the EVM. The state transition function is dominated by three things:

    ECADDs (for verifying BLS signatures)
    Pairings (for verifying BLS signatures)
    SHA256 hashes (for reading and updating the state)
    In each block, we need to prove 1-16 BLS12-381 ECADDs per validator (potentially more than one, because signatures can get included in multiple aggregates). This can be compensated for by subset precomputation techniques, so altogether we can say that it's one BLS12-381 ECADD per validator. Today, there are ~30,000 validators signing in each slot. In the future, with single slot finality, this could change in either direction (see the exposition here): if we take the "brute force" route, this could increase to 1 million validators per slot. Meanwhile, with Orbit SSF, it would stay at 32,768, or even decrease to 8,192.

    How BLS aggregation works. Verifying the aggregate signature only requires an ECADD per participant, instead of an ECMUL. But 30,000 ECADDs is still a lot to prove.For pairings, there is a current maximum of 128 attestations per slot, implying the need to verify 128 pairings. With EIP-7549 and further changes, this can plausibly decrease to 16 per slot. Pairings are few in number, but they are extremely expensive: each one takes thousands of times longer to run (or prove) than an ECADD.

    A major challenge with proving BLS12-381 operations is that there is no convenient curve whose curve order equals the BLS12-381 field size, which adds considerable overhead to any proving system. The Verkle trees proposed for Ethereum, on the other hand, were built with the Bandersnatch curve, which makes BLS12-381 itself the natural curve to use in a SNARK system to prove a Verkle branch. A fairly naive implementation can prove ~100 G1 additions per second; clever techniques like GKR would almost certainly be required to make proving fast enough.

    For SHA256 hashes, today the worst case is the epoch transition block, where the entire validator short-balance tree, and a significant number of validator balances, gets updated. The validator short-balance tree has one byte per validator, so ~1 MB of data gets re-hashed. This corresponds to 32,768 SHA256 calls. If a thousand validators' balances fall above or below a threshold that requires the effective balance, in the validator record, to be updated, that corresponds to a thousand Merkle branches, so perhaps another ten thousand hashes. The shuffling mechanism requires 90 bits per validator (so, 11 MB of data), but this can be computed at any time over the course of an epoch. With single-slot finality, these numbers may again increase or decrease depending on the details. Shuffling becomes unnecessary, though Orbit may bring back the need for some degree of it.

    Another challenge is the need to read all validator state, including public keys, in order to verify a block. Reading the public keys alone takes 48 million bytes for 1 million validators, together with Merkle branches. This requires millions of hashes per epoch. If we had to prove the proof-of-stake validation today, a realistic approach would be some form of incrementally verifiable computation: store a separate data structure inside the proof system that is optimized for efficient lookups, and prove updates to this structure.

    To summarize, there are a lot of challenges.

    Fixing these challenges most efficiently may well require a deep redesign of the beacon chain, which could happen at the same time as a switch to single-slot finality. Features of this redesign could include:

    Hash function change: today, the "full" SHA256 hash function gets used, so due to padding each call corresponds to two underlying compression function calls. At the very least, we can get a 2x gain by switching to the SHA256 compression function. If we switch to Poseidon, we can get a potentially ~100x gain, which could solve all of our problems (at least for hashes) completely: at 1.7 million hashes (54 MB) per second, even a million validator records can be "read" into a proof in a few seconds.
    If Orbit, store shuffled validator records directly: if you choose some number of validators (eg. 8,192 or 32,768) to be the committee for a given slot, put them directly into the state beside each other, so that the minimum amount of hashing is needed to read all validator pubkeys into a proof. This would also allow all balance updates to be done efficiently.
    Signature aggregation: any high-performance signature aggregation scheme will realistically involve some kind of recursive-proving, where intermediate proofs of subsets of signatures will get made by various nodes in the network. This naturally splits the load of proving across many nodes in the network, making the work of the "final prover" much smaller.
    Other signature schemes: For a Lamport+Merkle signature, we need 256 + 32 hashes to verify a signature; multiplying by 32,768 signers gives 9,437,184 hashes. Optimizations to the signature scheme can improve this further by a small constant factor. If we use Poseidon, this is within range to prove within a single slot. Realistically, though, this would be made much faster with recursive aggregation schemes.

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    Realistically, it will take years before we have a validity proof of the Ethereum consensus. This is roughly the same timeline that we need to implement single slot finality, Orbit, changes to the signature algorithm, and potentially security analysis needed to become sufficiently confident to use "aggressive" hash functions like Poseidon. Hence, it makes the most sense to work on these other problems, and while doing that work keep STARK-friendliness in mind.

    The main tradeoff may well be in order of operations, between a more incremental approach to reforming the Ethereum consensus layer and a more radical "many changes at once" approach. For the EVM, an incremental approach makes sense, because it minimizes disruption to backwards compatibility. For the consensus layer, backwards compatibility concerns are smaller, and there are benefits to a more "holistic" re-think in various details of how the beacon chain is constructed, to best optimize for SNARK-friendliness.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    STARK-friendliness needs to be a primary concern in long-term redesigns of the Ethereum proof of stake consensus, most notably single-slot finality, Orbit, changes to the signature scheme, and signature aggregation.


  - Blog Tittle: "Possible futures of the Ethereum protocol, part 3: The Scourge"
    Special thanks to Justin Drake, Caspar Schwarz-Schilling, Phil Daian, Dan Robinson, Charlie Noyes and Max Resnick for feedback and review, and the ethstakers community for discussion.

    One of the biggest risks to the Ethereum L1 is proof-of-stake centralizing due to economic pressures. If there are economies-of-scale in participating in core proof of stake mechanisms, this would naturally lead to large stakers dominating, and small stakers dropping out to join large pools. This leads to higher risk of 51% attacks, transaction censorship, and other crises. In addition to the centralization risk, there are also risks of value extraction: a small group capturing value that would otherwise go to Ethereum's users.

    Over the last year, our understanding of these risks has increased greatly. It's well understood that there are two key places where this risk exists: (i) block construction, and (ii) staking capital provision. Larger actors can afford to run more sophisticated algorithms ("MEV extraction") to generate blocks, giving them a higher revenue per block. Very large actors can also more effectively deal with the inconvenience of having their capital locked up, by releasing it to others as a liquid staking token (LST). In addition to the direct questions of small vs large stakers, there is also the question of whether or not there is (or will be) too much staked ETH.

    The Scourge, 2023 roadmapThis year, there have been significant advancements on block construction, most notably convergence on "committee inclusion lists plus some targeted solution for ordering" as the ideal solution, as well as significant research on proof of stake economics, including ideas such as two-tiered staking models and reducing issuance to cap the percent of ETH staked.


    The Scourge: key goals
    Minimize centralization risks at Ethereum's staking layer (notably, in block construction and capital provision, aka. MEV and staking pools)
    Minimize risks of excessive value extraction from users

    Fixing the block construction pipeline
    What problem are we solving?
    Today, Ethereum block construction is largely done through extra-protocol propser-builder separation with MEVBoost. When a validator gets an opportunity to propose a block, they auction off the job of choosing block contents to specialized actors called builders. The task of choosing block contents that maximize revenue is very economies-of-scale intensive: specialized algorithms are needed to determine which transactions to include, in order to extract as much value as possible from on-chain financial gadgets and users' transactions interacting with them (this is what is called "MEV extraction"). Validators are left with the relatively economies-of-scale-light "dumb pipe" task of listening for bids and accepting the highest bid, as well as other responsibilities like attesting.

    Stylized diagram of what MEVBoost is doing: specialized builders take on the tasks in the red, and stakers take on the tasks in blue.There are various versions of this, including "proposer-builder separation" (PBS) and "attester-proposer separation" (APS). The difference between these has to do with fine-grained details around which responsibilities go to which of the two actors: roughly, in PBS, validators still propose blocks, but receive the payload from builders, and in APS, the entire slot becomes the builder's responsibility. Recently, APS is preferred over PBS, because it further reduces incentives for proposers to co-locate with builders. Note that APS would only apply to execution blocks, which contain transactions; consensus blocks, which contain proof-of-stake-related data such as attestations, would still be randomly assigned to validators.

    This separation of powers helps keep validators decentralized, but it has one important cost: the actors that are doing the "specialized" tasks can easily become very centralized. Here's Ethereum block building today:Two actors are choosing the contents of roughly 88% of Ethereum blocks. What if those two actors decide to censor a transaction? The answer is not quite as bad as it might seem: they are not able to reorg blocks, and so you don't need 51% censoring to prevent a transaction from getting included at all: you need 100%. With 88% censoring, a user would need to wait an average of 9 slots to get included (technically, an average of 114 seconds, instead of 6 seconds). For some use cases, waiting for two or even five minutes for certain transactions is fine. But for other use cases, eg. defi liquidations, even the ability to delay inclusion of someone else's transaction by a few blocks is a significant market manipulation risk.

    The strategies that block builders can employ to maximize revenue can also have other negative consequences for users. A "sandwich attack" could cause users making token swaps to suffer significant losses from slippage. The transactions introduced to make these attacks clog the chain, increasing gas prices for other users.

    What is it, and how does it work?
    The leading solution is to break down the block production task further: we give the task of choosing transactions back to the proposer (ie. a staker), and the builder can only choose the ordering and insert some transactions of their own. This is what inclusion lists seek to do.At time T, a randomly selected staker creates an inclusion list, a list of transactions that are valid given the current state of the blockchain at that time. At time T+1, a block builder, perhaps chosen through an in-protocol auction mechanism ahead of time, creates a block. This block is required to include every transaction in the inclusion list, but they can choose the order, and they can add in their own transactions.

    Fork-choice-enforced inclusion lists (FOCIL) proposals involve a committee of multiple inclusion list creators per block. To delay a transaction by one block, k of k inclusion list creators (eg. k = 16 ) would have to censor the transaction. The combination of FOCIL with a final proposer chosen by auction that is required to include the inclusion lists, but can reorder and add new transactions, is often called "FOCIL + APS".

    A different approach to the problem is multiple concurrent proposers (MCP) schemes such as BRAID. BRAID seeks to avoid splitting up the block proposer role into a low-economies-of-scale part and a high-economies-of-scale part, and instead tries to distribute the block production process among many actors, in such a way that each proposer only needs to have a medium amount of sophistication to maximize their revenue. MCP works by having k parallel proposers generate lists of transactions, and then using a deterministic algorithm (eg. order by highest-to-lowest fee) to choose the order.BRAID does not seek to attain the goal of dumb-pipe block proposers running default software being optimal. Two easy-to-understand reasons why it cannot do so are:

    Last-mover arbitrage attacks: suppose that the average time that proposers submit is T, and the last possible time you can submit and still get included is around T+1. Now, suppose that on centralized exchanges, the ETH/USDC price moves from $2500 to $2502 between T and T+1. A proposer can wait an extra second and add an additional transaction to arbitrage on-chain decentralized exchanges, claiming up to $2 per ETH in profit. Sophisticated proposers who are very well-connected to the network have more ability to do this.
    Exclusive order flow: users have the incentive to send transactions directly to one single proposer, to minimize their vulnerability to front-running and other attacks. Sophisticated proposers have an advantage because they can set up infrastructure to accept these direct-from-user transactions, and they have stronger reputations so users who send them transactions can trust that the proposer will not betray and front-run them (this can be mitigated with trusted hardware, but then trusted hardware has trust assumptions of its own)
    In BRAID, attesters can still be separated off and run as a dumb-pipe functionality.

    In addition to these two extremes, there is a spectrum of possible designs in between. For example, you could auction off a role that only has the right to append to a block, and not to reorder or prepend. You could even let them append or prepend, but not insert in the middle or reorder. The attraction of these techniques is that the winners of the auction market are likely to be very concentrated, and so there is a lot of benefit to reducing their authority.

    Encrypted mempools
    One technology that is crucial to the successful implementation of many of these designs (specifically, either BRAID or a version of APS where there are strict limits on the capability being auctionef off) is encrypted mempools. Encrypted mempools are a technology where users broadcast their transactions in encrypted form, along with some kind of proof of their validity, and the transactions are included into blocks in encrypted form, without the block builder knowing the contents. The contents of the transactions are revealed later.

    The main challenge in implementing encrypted mempools is coming up with a design that ensures that transactions do all get revealed later: a simple "commit and reveal" scheme does not work, because if revealing is voluntary, the act of choosing to reveal or not reveal is itself a kind of "last-mover" influence on a block that could be exploited. The two leading techniques for this are (i) threshold decryption, and (ii) delay encryption, a primitive closely related to verifiable delay functions (VDFs).

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    We can think of all of the above schemes as being different ways of dividing up the authority involved in staking, arranged on a spectrum from lower economies of scale ("dumb-pipe") to higher economies of scale ("specialization-friendly"). Pre-2021, all of these authorities were bundled together in one actor:The core conundrum is this: any meaningful authority that remains in the hands of stakers, is authority that could end up being "MEV-relevant". We want a highly decentralized set of actors to have as much authority as possible; this implies (i) putting a lot of authority in the hands of stakers, and (ii) making sure stakers are as decentralized as possible, meaning that they have few economies-of-scale-driven incentives to consolidate. This is a difficult tension to navigate.

    One particular challenge is multi-block MEV: in some cases, execution auction winners can make even more money if they capture multiple slots in a row, and do not allow any MEV-relevant transactions in blocks other than the last one that they control. If inclusion lists force them to, then they can try to bypass that by not publishing any block at all during those slots. One could make unconditional inclusion lists, which directly become the block if the builder does not provide one, but this makes the inclusion list MEV-relevant. The solution here may involve some compromise that involves accepting some low degree of incentive to bribe people to include transactions in an inclusion list, and hoping that it's not high enough to lead to mass outsourcing.

    We can view FOCIL + APS as follows. Stakers continue to have the authority on the left part of the spectrum, while the right part of the spectrum gets auctioned off to the highest bidder.BRAID is quite different. The "staker" piece is larger, but it gets split into two pieces: light stakers and heavy stakers. Meanwhile, because transactions are ordered in decreasing order of priority fee, the top-of-block choice gets de-facto auctioned off via the fee market, in a scheme that can be viewed as analogous to enshrined PBS.Note that the safety of BRAID depends heavily on encrypted mempools; otherwise, the top-of-block auction mechanism becomes vulnerable to strategy-stealing attacks (essentially: copying other people's transactions, swapping the recipient address, and paying a 0.01% higher fee). This need for pre-inclusion privacy is also the reason why enshrined PBS is so tricky to implement.

    Finally, more "aggressive" versions of FOCIL + APS, eg. the option where APS only determines the end of the block, look like this:The main remaining task is to (i) work on solidifying the various proposals and analyzing their consequences, and (ii) combine this analysis with an understanding of the Ethereum community's goals in terms of what forms of centralization it will tolerate. There is also work to be done on each individual proposal, such as:

    Continuing work on encrypted mempool designs, and getting to the point where we have a design that is both robust and reasonably simple, and plausibly ready for inclusion.
    Optimizing the design of multiple inclusion lists to make sure that (i) it does not waste data, particularly in the context of inclusion lists covering blobs, and (ii) it is friendly to stateless validators.
    More work on the optimal auction design for APS.
    Additionally, it's worth noting that these different proposals are not necessarily incompatible forks on the road from each other. For example, implementing FOCIL + APS could easily serve as a stepping stone to implementing BRAID. A valid conservative strategy would be a "wait-and-see" approach where we first implement a solution where stakers' authority is limited and most of the authority is auctioned off, and then slowly increase stakers' authority over time as we learn more about the MEV market operation on the live network.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    There are positive interactions between solving one staking centralization bottleneck and solving the others. To give an analogy, imagine a world where starting your own company required growing your own food, making your own computers and having your own army. In this world, only a few companies could exist. Solving one of the three problems would help the situation, but only a little. Solving two problems would help more than twice as much as solving one. And solving three would be far more than three times as helpful - if you're a solo entrepreneur, either 3/3 problems are solved or you stand no chance.

    In particular, the centralization bottlenecks for staking are:

    Block construction centralization (this section)
    Staking centralization for economic reasons (next section)
    Staking centralization because of the 32 ETH minimum (solved with Orbit or other techniques; see the post on the Merge)
    Staking centralization because of hardware requirements (solved in the Verge, with stateless clients and later ZK-EVMs)
    Solving any one of the four increases the gains from solving any of the others.

    Additionally, there are interactions between the block construction pipeline and the single slot finality design, particularly in the context of trying to reduce slot times. Many block construction pipeline designs end up increasing slot times. Many block construction pipelines involve roles for attesters at multiple steps in the process. For this reason, it can be worth thinking about the block construction pipelines and single slot finality simultaneously.


    Fixing staking economics
    What problem are we solving?
    Today, about 30% of the ETH supply is actively staking. This is far more than enough to protect Ethereum from 51% attacks. If the percent of ETH staked grows much larger, researchers fear a different scenario: the risks that would arise if almost all ETH becomes staked. These risks include:

    Staking turns from being a profitable task for specialists into a duty for all ETH holders. Hence, the average staker would be much more unenthusiastic, and would choose the easiest approach (realistically, delegating their tokens to whichever centralized operator offers the most convenience)
    Credibility of the slashing mechanism weakens if almost all ETH is staked
    A single liquid staking token could take over the bulk of the stake and even taking over "money" network effects from ETH itself
    Ethereum needlessly issuing an extra ~1m ETH/year. In the case where one liquid staking token gets dominant network effect, a large portion of this value could potentially even get captured by the LST.
    What is it, and how does it work?
    Historically, one class of solution has been: if everyone staking is inevitable, and a liquid staking token is inevitable, then let's make staking friendly to having a liquid staking token that is actually trustless, neutral and maximally decentralized. One simple way to do this is to cap staking penalties at eg. 1/8, which would make 7/8 of staked ETH unslashable, and thus eligible to be put into the same liquid staking token. Another option is to explicitly create two tiers of staking: "risk-bearing" (slashable) staking, which would somehow be capped to eg. 1/8 of all ETH, and "risk-free" (unslashable) staking, which everyone could participate in.

    However, one criticism of this approach is that it seems economically equivalent to something much simpler: massively reduce issuance if the stake approaches some pre-determined cap. The basic argument is: if we end up in a world where the risk-bearing tier has 3.4% returns and the risk-free tier (which everyone participates in) has 2.6% returns, that's actually the same thing as a world where staking ETH has 0.8% returns and just holding ETH has 0% returns. The dynamics of the risk-bearing tier, including both total quantity staked and centralization, would be the same in both cases. And so we should just do the simple thing and reduce issuance.

    The main counterargument to this line of argument would be if we can make the "risk-free tier" still have some useful role and some level of risk (eg. as proposed by Dankrad here).

    Both of these lines of proposals imply changing the issuance curve, in a way that makes returns prohibitively low if the amount of stake gets too high. 

    Left: one proposal for an adjusted issuance curve, by Justin Drake. Right: another set of proposals, by Anders Elowsson.Two-tier staking, on the other hand, requires setting two return curves: (i) the return rate for "basic" (risk-free or low-risk) staking, and (ii) the premium for risk-bearing staking. There are different ways to set these parameters: for example, if you set a hard parameter that 1/8 of stake is slashable, then market dynamics will determine the premium on the return rate that slashable stake gets.

    Another important topic here is MEV capture. Today, revenue from MEV (eg. DEX arbitrage, sandwiching...) goes to proposers, ie. stakers. This is revenue that is completely "opaque" to the protocol: the protocol has no way of knowing if it's 0.01% APR, 1% APR or 20% APR. The existence of this revenue stream is highly inconvenient from multiple angles:

    It is a volatile revenue source, as each individual staker only gets it when they propose a block, which is once every ~4 months today. This creates an incentive to join pools for more stable income.
    It leads to an unbalanced allocation of incentives: too much for proposing, too little for attesting.
    It makes stake capping very difficult to implement: even if the "official" return rate is zero, the MEV revenue alone may be enough to drive all ETH holders to stake. As a result, a realistic stake capping proposal would in fact have to have returns approach negative infinity, as eg. proposed here. This, needless to say, creates more risk for stakers, especially solo stakers.
    We can solve these problems by finding a way to make MEV revenue legible to the protocol, and capturing it. The earliest proposal was Francesco's MEV smoothing; today, it's widely understood that any mechanism for auctioning off block proposer rights (or, more generally, sufficient authority to capture almost all MEV) ahead of time accomplishes the same goal.

    MEV burn, by Justin Drake: https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-burn-a-simple-design/15590
    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    The main remaining task is to either agree to do nothing, and accept the risks of almost all ETH being inside LSTs, or finalize and agree on the details and parameters of one of the above proposals. An approximate summary of the benefits and risks is:Policy	Need to decide	Risks to analyze
    Do nothing	* MEV burn implementation, if any	* Almost 100% of ETH staked, likely in LSTs (perhaps a single dominant one)
    * Macroeconomic risks
    Stake capping (via changing issuance curve)	* Reward function and parameters (esp. what the cap is)
    * MEV burn implementation	* Open question of which stakers enter and leave, possibility that remaining staker set is centralized
    * Two-tiered staking	* The role of the risk-free tier
    * Parameters (eg. the economics that determine the amount staked in the risk-bearing tier)
    * MEV burn implementation	* Open question of which stakers enter and leave, possibility that risk-bearing set is centralized


    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    One important point of intersection has to do with solo staking. Today, the cheapest VPSes that can run an Ethereum node cost about $60 per month, primarily due to hard disk storage costs. For a 32 ETH staker ($84,000 at the time of this writing), this decreases APY by (60 * 12) / 84000 ~= 0.85% . If total staking returns drop below 0.85%, solo staking will be unviable for many people at these levels.

    If we want solo staking to continue to be viable, this puts further emphasis on the need to reduce node operation costs, which will be done in the Verge: statelessness will remove storage space requirements, which may be sufficient on its own, and then L1 EVM validity proofs will make costs completely trivial.

    On the other hand, MEV burn arguably helps solo staking. Although it decreases returns for everyone, it more importantly decreases variance, making staking less like a lottery.

    Finally, any change in issuance interacts with other fundamental changes to the staking design (eg. rainbow staking). One particular point of concern is that if staking returns become very low, this means we have to choose between (i) making penalties also low, reducing disincentives against bad behavior, and (ii) keeping penalties high, which would increase the set of circumstances in which even well-meaning validators accidentally end up with negative returns if they get unlucky with technical issues or even attacks.

    Application layer solutions
    The above sections focused on changes to the Ethereum L1 that can solve important centralization risks. However, Ethereum is not just an L1, it is an ecosystem, and there are also important application-layer strategies that can help mitigate the above risks. A few examples include:

    Specialized staking hardware solutions - some companies, such as Dappnode, are selling hardware that is specifically designed to make it as easy as possible to operate a staking node. One way to make this solution more effective, is to ask the question: if a user is already spending the effort to have a box running and connected to the internet 24/7, what other services could it provide (to the user or to others) that benefit from decentralization? Examples that come to mind include (i) running locally hosted LLMs, for self-sovereignty and privacy reasons, and (ii) running nodes for a decentralized VPN.
    Squad staking - this solution from Obol allows multiple people to stake together in an M-of-N format. This will likely get more and more popular over time, as statelessness and later L1 EVM validity proofs will reduce the overhead of running more nodes, and the benefit of each individual participant needing to worry much less about being online all the time starts to dominate. This is another way to reduce the cognitive overhead of staking, and ensure solo staking prospers in the future.
    Airdrops - Starknet gave an airdrop to solo stakers. Other projects wishing to have a decentralized and values-aligned set of users may also consider giving airdrops or discounts to validators that are identified as probably being solo stakers.
    Decentralized block building marketplaces - using a combination of ZK, MPC and TEEs, it's possible to create a decentralized block builder that participates in, and wins, the APS auction game, but at the same time provides pre-confirmation privacy and censorship resistance guarantees to its users. This is another path toward improving users' welfare in an APS world.
    Application-layer MEV minimization - individual applications can be built in a way that "leaks" less MEV to L1, reducing the incentive for block builders to create specialized algorithms to collect it. One simple strategy that is universal, though inconvenient and composability-breaking, is for the contract to put all incoming operations into a queue and execute them in the next block, and auction off the right to jump the queue. Other more sophisticated approaches include doing more work offchain eg. as Cowswap does. Oracles can also be redesigned to minimize oracle-extractable value.


  - Blog Tittle: "Possible futures of the Ethereum protocol, part 2: The Surge"
    Special thanks to Justin Drake, Francesco, Hsiao-wei Wang, @antonttc and Georgios Konstantopoulos

    At the beginning, Ethereum had two scaling strategies in its roadmap. One (eg. see this early paper from 2015) was "sharding": instead of verifying and storing all of the transactions in the chain, each node would only need to verify and store a small fraction of the transactions. This is how any other peer-to-peer network (eg. BitTorrent) works too, so surely we could make blockchains work the same way. Another was layer 2 protocols: networks that would sit on top of Ethereum in a way that allow them to fully benefit from its security, while keeping most data and computation off the main chain. "Layer 2 protocols" meant state channels in 2015, Plasma in 2017, and then rollups in 2019. Rollups are more powerful than state channels or Plasma, but they require a large amount of on-chain data bandwidth. Fortunately, by 2019 sharding research had solved the problem of verifying "data availability" at scale. As a result, the two paths converged, and we got the rollup-centric roadmap which continues to be Ethereum's scaling strategy today.

    The Surge, 2023 roadmap edition.The rollup-centric roadmap proposes a simple division of labor: the Ethereum L1 focuses on being a robust and decentralized base layer, while L2s take on the task of helping the ecosystem scale. This is a pattern that recurs everywhere in society: the court system (L1) is not there to be ultra-fast and efficient, it's there to protect contracts and property rights, and it's up to entrepreneurs (L2) to build on top of that sturdy base layer and take humanity to (metaphorical and literal) Mars.

    This year, the rollup-centric roadmap has seen important successes: Ethereum L1 data bandwidth has increased greatly with EIP-4844 blobs, and multiple EVM rollups are now at stage 1. A very heterogeneous and pluralistic implementation of sharding, where each L2 acts as a "shard" with its own internal rules and logic, is now reality. But as we have seen, taking this path has some unique challenges of its own. And so now our task is to bring the rollup-centric roadmap to completion, and solve these problems, while preserving the robustness and decentralization that makes the Ethereum L1 special.

    The Surge: key goals
    100,000+ TPS on L1+L2
    Preserve decentralization and robustness of L1
    At least some L2s fully inherit Ethereum's core properties (trustless, open, censorship resistant)
    Maximum interoperability between L2s. Ethereum should feel like one ecosystem, not 34 different blockchains.

    Aside: the scalability trilemma
    The scalability trilemma was an idea introduced in 2017, which argued that there is a tension between three properties of a blockchain: decentralization (more specifically: low cost to run a node), scalability (more specifically: high number of transactions processed), and security (more specifically: an attacker needing to corrupt a large portion of the nodes in the whole network to make even a single transaction fail).Notably, the trilemma is not a theorem, and the post introducing the trilemma did not come with a mathematical proof. It did give a heuristic mathematical argument: if a decentralization-friendly node (eg. consumer laptop) can verify N transactions per second, and you have a chain that processes k*N transactions per second, then either (i) each transaction is only seen by 1/k of nodes, which implies an attacker only needs to corrupt a few nodes to push a bad transaction through, or (ii) your nodes are going to be beefy and your chain not decentralized. The purpose of the post was never to show that breaking the trilemma is impossible; rather, it was to show that breaking the trilemma is hard - it requires somehow thinking outside of the box that the argument implies.

    For many years, it has been common for some high-performance chains to claim that they solve the trilemma without doing anything clever at a fundamental architecture level, typically by using software engineering tricks to optimize the node. This is always misleading, and running a node in such chains always ends up far more difficult than in Ethereum. This post gets into some of the many subtleties why this is the case (and hence, why L1 client software engineering alone cannot scale Ethereum itself).

    However, the combination of data availability sampling and SNARKs does solve the trilemma: it allows a client to verify that some quantity of data is available, and some number of steps of computation were carried out correctly, while downloading only a small portion of that data and running a much smaller amount of computation. SNARKs are trustless. Data availability sampling has a nuanced few-of-N trust model, but it preserves the fundamental property that non-scalable chains have, which is that even a 51% attack cannot force bad blocks to get accepted by the network.

    Another way to solve the trilemma is Plasma architectures, which use clever techniques to push the responsibility to watch for data availability to the user in an incentive-compatible way. Back in 2017-2019, when all we had to scale computation was fraud proofs, Plasma was very limited in what it could safely do, but the mainstreaming of SNARKs makes Plasma architectures far more viable for a wider array of use cases than before.


    Further progress in data availability sampling
    What problem are we solving?
    As of 2024 March 13, when the Dencun upgrade went live, the Ethereum blockchain has three ~125 kB "blobs" per 12-second slot, or ~375 kB per slot of data availability bandwidth. Assuming transaction data is published onchain directly, an ERC20 transfer is ~180 bytes, and so the maximum TPS of rollups on Ethereum is:

    375000 / 12 / 180 = 173.6 TPS

    If we add Ethereum's calldata (theoretical max: 30 million gas per slot / 16 gas per byte = 1,875,000 bytes per slot), this becomes 607 TPS. With PeerDAS, the plan is to increase the blob count target to 8-16, which would give us 463-926 TPS in calldata.

    This is a major increase over the Ethereum L1, but it is not enough. We want much more scalability. Our medium-term target is 16 MB per slot, which if combined with improvements in rollup data compression would give us ~58,000 TPS.

    What is it and how does it work?
    PeerDAS is a relatively simple implementation of "1D sampling". Each blob in Ethereum is a degree-4096 polynomial over a 253-bit prime field. We broadcast "shares" of the polynomial, where each share consists of 16 evaluations at an adjacent 16 coordinates taken from a total set of 8192 coordinates. Any 4096 of the 8192 evaluations (with current proposed parameters: any 64 of the 128 possible samples) can recover the blob.PeerDAS works by having each client listen on a small number of subnets, where the i'th subnet broadcasts the i'th sample of any blob, and additionally asks for blobs on other subnets that it needs by asking its peers in the global p2p network (who would be listening to different subnets). A more conservative version, SubnetDAS, uses only the subnet mechanism, without the additional layer of asking peers. A current proposal is for nodes participating in proof of stake to use SubnetDAS, and for other nodes (ie. "clients") to use PeerDAS.

    Theoretically, we can scale 1D sampling pretty far: if we increase the blob count maximum to 256 (so, the target to 128), then we would get to our 16 MB target while data availability sampling would only cost each node 16 samples * 128 blobs * 512 bytes per sample per blob = 1 MB of data bandwidth per slot. This is just barely within our reach of tolerance: it's doable, but it would mean bandwidth-constrained clients cannot sample. We could optimize this somewhat by decreasing blob count and increasing blob size, but this would make reconstruction more expensive.

    And so ultimately we want to go further, and do 2D sampling, which works by random sampling not just within blobs, but also between blobs. The linear properties of KZG commitments are used to "extend" the set of blobs in a block with a list of new "virtual blobs" that redundantly encode the same information.

    2D sampling. Source: a16z cryptoCrucially, computing the extension of the commitments does not require having the blobs, so the scheme is fundamentally friendly to distributed block construction. The node actually constructing the block would only need to have the blob KZG commitments, and can themslves rely on DAS to verify the availability of the blobs. 1D DAS is also inherently friendly to distributed block construction.

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    The immediate next step is to finish the implementation and rollout of PeerDAS. From there, it's a progressive grind to keep increasing the blob count on PeerDAS while carefully watching the network and improving the software to ensure safety. At the same time, we want more academic work on formalizing PeerDAS and other versions of DAS and its interactions with issues such as fork choice rule safety.

    Further into the future, we need much more work figuring out the ideal version of 2D DAS and proving its safety properties. We also want to eventually migrate away from KZG to a quantum-resistant, trusted-setup-free alternative. Currently, we do not know of candidates that are friendly to distributed block building. Even the expensive "brute force" technique of using recursive STARKs to generate proofs of validity for reconstructing rows and columns does not suffice, because while technically a STARK is O(log(n) * log(log(n)) hashes in size (with STIR), in practice a STARK is almost as big as a whole blob.

    The realistic paths I see for the long term are:

    Implement ideal 2D DAS
    Stick with 1D DAS, sacrificing sampling bandwidth efficiency and accepting a lower data cap for the sake of simplicity and robustness
    (Hard pivot) abandon DA, and fully embrace Plasma as a primary layer 2 architecture we are focusing on
    We can view these along a tradeoff spectrum:Note that this choice exists even if we decide to scale execution on L1 directly. This is because if L1 is to process lots of TPS, L1 blocks will become very big, and clients will want an efficient way to verify that they are correct, so we would have to use the same technology that powers rollups (ZK-EVM and DAS) at L1.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    The need for 2D DAS is somewhat lessened, or at least delayed, if data compression (see below) is implemented, and it's lessened even further if Plasma is widely used. DAS also poses a challenge to distributed block building protocols and mechanisms: while DAS is theoretically friendly to distributed reconstruction, this needs to be combined in practice with inclusion list proposals and their surrounding fork choice mechanics.


    Data compression
    What problem are we solving?
    Each transaction in a rollup takes a significant amount of data space onchain: an ERC20 transfer takes about 180 bytes. Even with ideal data availability sampling, this puts a cap on scalability of layer 2 protocols. With 16 MB per slot, we get:

    16000000 / 12 / 180 = 7407 TPS

    What if in addition to tackling the numerator, we can also tackle the denominator, and make each transaction in a rollup take fewer bytes onchain?

    What is it and how does it work?
    The best explanation in my opinion is this diagram from two years ago:The simplest gains are just zero-byte compression: replacing each long sequence of zero bytes with two bytes representing how many zero bytes there are. To go further, we take advantage of the specific properties of transactions:

    Signature aggregation - we switch from ECDSA signatures to BLS signatures, which have the property that many signatures can be combined together into a single signature that attests for the validity of all of the original signatures. This is not considered for L1 because the computational costs of verification, even with aggregation, are higher, but in a data-scarce environment like L2s, they arguably make sense. The aggregation feature of ERC-4337 presents one path for implementing this.
    Replacing addresses with pointers - if an address was used before, we can replace the 20-byte address with a 4-byte pointer to a location in history. This is needed to achieve the biggest gains, though it takes effort to implement, because it requires (at least a portion of) the blockchain's history to effectively become part of the state.
    Custom serialization for transaction values - most transaction values have very few digits, eg. 0.25 ETH is represented as 250,000,000,000,000,000 wei. Gas max-basefees and priority fees work similarly. We can thus represent most currency values very compactly with a custom decimal floating point format, or even a dictionary of especially common values.

    BLS wallet - an implementation of BLS aggregation through ERC-4337: https://github.com/getwax/bls-wallet
    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    The main thing left to do is to actually implement the above schemes. The main tradeoffs are:

    Switching to BLS signatures takes significant effort, and reduces compatibility with trusted hardware chips that can increase security. A ZK-SNARK wrapper around other signature schemes could be used to replace this.
    Dynamic compression (eg. replacing addresses with pointers) complicates client code.
    Posting state diffs to chain instead of transactions reduces auditability, and makes a lot of software (eg. block explorers) not work.
    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    Adoption of ERC-4337, and eventually the enshrinement of parts of it in L2 EVMs, can greatly hasten the deployment of aggregation techniques. Enshrinement of parts of ERC-4337 on L1 can hasten its deployment on L2s.


    Generalized Plasma
    What problem are we solving?
    Even with 16 MB blobs and data compression, 58,000 TPS is not necessarily enough to fully take over consumer payments, decentralized social or other high-bandwidth sectors, and this becomes especially true if we start taking privacy into account, which could drop scalability by 3-8x. For high-volume, low-value applications, one option today is a validium, which keeps data off-chain and has an interesting security model where the operator cannot steal users' funds, but they can disappear and temporarily or permanently freeze all users' funds. But we can do better.

    What is it and how does it work?
    Plasma is a scaling solution that involves an operator publishing blocks offchain, and putting the Merkle roots of those blocks onchain (as opposed to rollups, where the full block is put onchain). For each block, the operator sends to each user a Merkle branch proving what happened, or did not happen, to that user's assets. Users can withdraw their assets by providing a Merkle branch. Importantly, this branch does not have to be rooted in the latest state - for this reason, even if data availability fails, the user can still recover their assets by withdrawing the latest state they have that is available. If a user submits an invalid branch (eg. exiting an asset that they already sent to someone else, or the operator themselves creating an asset out of thin air), an onchain challenge mechanism can adjudicate who the asset rightfully belongs to.

    A diagram of a Plasma Cash chain. Transactions spending coin i are put into the i'th position in the tree. In this example, assuming all previous trees are valid, we know that Eve currently owns coin 1, David owns coin 4 and George owns coin 6.Early versions of Plasma were only able to handle the payments use case, and were not able to effectively generalize further. If we require each root to be verified with a SNARK, however, Plasma becomes much more powerful. Each challenge game can be simplified significantly, because we take away most possible paths for the operator to cheat. New paths also open up to allow Plasma techniques to be extended to a much more general class of assets. Finally, in the case where the operator does not cheat, users can withdraw their funds instantly, without needing to wait for a one-week challenge period.

    One way (not the only way) to make an EVM plasma chain: use a ZK-SNARK to construct a parallel UTXO tree that reflects the balance changes made by the EVM, and defines a unique mapping of what is "the same coin" at different points in history. A Plasma construction can then be built on top of that.One key insight is that the Plasma system does not need to be perfect. Even if you can only protect a subset of assets (eg. even just coins that have not moved in the past week), you've already greatly improved on the status quo of ultra-scalable EVM, which is a validium.

    Another class of constructions is hybrid plasma/rollups, such as Intmax. These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    The main remaining task is to bring Plasma systems to production. As mentioned above, "plasma vs validium" is not a binary: any validium can have its safety properties improved at least a little bit by adding Plasma features into the exit mechanism. The research part is in getting optimal properties (in terms of trust requirements, and worst-case L1 gas cost, and vulnerability to DoS) for an EVM, as well as alternative application specific constructions. Additionally, the greater conceptual complexity of Plasma relative to rollups needs to be addressed directly, both through research and through construction of better generalized frameworks.

    The main tradeoff in using Plasma designs is that they depend more on operators and are harder to make "based", though hybrid plasma/rollup designs can often avoid this weakness.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    The more effective Plasma solutions can be, the less pressure there is for the L1 to have a high-performance data availability functionality. Moving activity to L2 also reduces MEV pressure on L1.


    Maturing L2 proof systems
    What problem are we solving?
    Today, most rollups are not yet actually trustless; there is a security council that has the ability to override the behavior of the (optimistic or validity) proof system. In some cases, the proof system is not even live at all, or if it is it only has an "advisory" functionality. The furthest ahead are (i) a few application-specific rollups, such as Fuel, which are trustless, and (ii) as of the time of this writing, Optimism and Arbitrum, two full-EVM rollups that have achieved a partial-trustlessness milestone known as "stage 1". The reason why rollups have not gone further is concern about bugs in the code. We need trustless rollups, and so we need to tackle this problem head on.

    What is it and how does it work?
    First, let us recap the "stage" system, originally introduced in this post. There are more detailed requirements, but the summary is:

    Stage 0: it must be possible for a user to run a node and sync the chain. It's ok if validation is fully trusted/centralized.
    Stage 1: there must be a (trustless) proof system that ensures that only valid transactions get accepted. It's allowed for there to be a security council that can override the proof system, but only with a 75% threshold vote. Additionally, a quorum-blocking portion of the council (so, 26%+) must be outside the main company building the rollup. An upgrade mechanism with weaker features (eg. a DAO) is allowed, but it must have a delay long enough that if it approves a malicious upgrade, users can exit their funds before it comes online.
    Stage 2: there must be a (trustless) proof system that ensures that only valid transactions get accepted. Security councils are only allowed to intervene in the event of provable bugs in the code, eg. if two redundant proof systems disagree with each other or if one proof system accepts two different post-state roots for the same block (or accepts nothing for a sufficiently long period of time eg. a week). An upgrade mechanism is allowed, but it must have a very long delay.
    The goal is to reach Stage 2. The main challenge in reaching stage 2 is getting enough confidence that the proof system actually is trustworthy enough. There are two major ways to do this:

    Formal verification: we can use modern mathematical and computational techniques to prove that an (optimistic or validity) proof system only accept blocks that pass the EVM specification. These techniques have existed for decades, but recent advancements such as Lean 4 have made them much more practical, and advancements in AI-assisted proving could potentially accelerate this trend further.
    Multi-provers: make multiple proof systems, and put funds into a 2-of-3 (or larger) multisig between those proof systems and a security council (and/or other gadget with trust assumptions, eg. TEEs). If the proof systems agree, the security council has no power; if they disagree, the security council can only choose between one of them, it can't unilaterally impose its own answer.Stylized diagram of a multi-prover, combining one optimistic proof system, one validity proof system and a security council.What are some links to existing research?

    Taiko plans to use multi-proofs: https://docs.taiko.xyz/core-concepts/multi-proofs/
    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    For formal verification, a lot. We need to create a formally verified version of an entire SNARK prover of an EVM. This is an incredibly complex project, though it is one that we have already started. There is one trick that significantly simplifies the task: we can make a formally verified SNARK prover of a minimal VM, eg. RISC-V or Cairo, and then write an implementation of the EVM in that minimal VM (and formally prove its equivalence to some other EVM specification).

    For multi-provers, there are two main remaining pieces. First, we need to get enough confidence in at least two different proof systems, both that they are reasonably safe individually and that if they break, they would break for different and unrelated reasons (and so they would not break at the same time). Second, we need to get a very high level of assurance in the underlying logic that merges the proof systems. This is a much smaller piece of code. There are ways to make it extremely small - just store funds in a Safe multisig contract whose signers are contracts representing individual proof systems - but this has the tradeoff of high onchain gas costs. Some balance between efficiency and safety will need to be found.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    Moving activity to L2 reduces MEV pressure on L1.


    Cross-L2 interoperability improvements
    What problem are we solving?
    One major challenge with the L2 ecosystem today is that it is difficult for users to navigate. Furthermore, the easiest ways of doing so often re-introduce trust assumptions: centralized bridges, RPC clients, and so forth. If we are serious about the idea that L2s are part of Ethereum, we need to make using the L2 ecosystem feel like using a unified Ethereum ecosystem.

    An example of pathologically bad (and even dangerous: I personally lost $100 to a chain-selection mistake here) cross-L2 UX - though this is not Polymarket's fault, cross-L2 interoperability should be the responsibility of wallets and the Ethereum standards (ERC) community. In a well-functioning Ethereum ecosystem, sending coins from L1 to L2, or from one L2 to another, should feel just like sending coins within the same L1.What is it and how does it work?
    There are many categories of cross-L2 interoperability improvements. In general, the way to come up with these is to notice that in theory, a rollup-centric Ethereum is the same thing as L1 execution sharding, and then ask where the current Ethereum L2-verse falls short of that ideal in practice. Here are a few:

    Chain-specific addresses: the chain (L1, Optimism, Arbitrum...) should be part of the address. Once this is implemented, cross-L2 sending flows can be implemented by just putting the address into the "send" field, at which point the wallet can figure out how to do the send (including using bridging protocols) in the background.
    Chain-specific payment requests: it should be easy and standardized to make a message of the form "send me X tokens of type Y on chain Z". This has two primary use cases: (i) payments, whether person-to-person or person-to-merchant-service, and (ii) dapps requesting funds, eg. the Polymarket example above.
    Cross-chain swaps and gas payment: there should be a standardized open protocol for expressing cross-chain operations such as "I am sending 1 ETH on Optimism to whoever sends me 0.9999 ETH on Arbitrum", and "I am sending 0.0001 ETH on Optimism to whoever includes this transaction on Arbitrum". ERC-7683 is one attempt at the former, and RIP-7755 is one attempt at the latter, though both are also more general than just these specific use cases.
    Light clients: users should be able to actually verify the chains that they are interacting with, and not just trust RPC providers. A16z crypto's Helios does this for Ethereum itself, but we need to extend this trustlessness to L2s. ERC-3668 (CCIP-read) is one strategy for doing this.How a light client can update its view of the Ethereum header chain. Once you have the header chain, you can use Merkle proofs to validate any state object. And once you have the right L1 state objects, you can use Merkle proofs (and possibly signatures, if you want to check preconfirmations) to validate any state object on L2. Helios does the former already. Extending to the latter is a standardization challenge.Keystore wallets: today, if you want to update the keys that control your smart contract wallet, you have to do it on all N chains on which that wallet exists. Keystore wallets are a technique that allow the keys to exist in one place (either on L1, or later potentially on an L2), and then be read from any L2 that has a copy of the wallet. This means that updates only need to happen once. To be efficient, keystore wallets require L2s to have a standardized way to costlessly read L1; two proposals for this are L1SLOAD and REMOTESTATICCALL.
    A stylized diagram of how keystore wallets work.More radical "shared token bridge" ideas: imagine a world where all L2s are validity proof rollups, that commit to Ethereum every slot. Even in this world, moving assets from one L2 to another L2 "natively" would require withdrawaing and depositing, which requires paying a substantial amount of L1 gas. One way to solve this is to create a shared minimal rollup, whose only function would be to maintain the balances of how many tokens of which type are owned by which L2, and allow those balances to be updated en masse by a series of cross-L2 send operations initiated by any of the L2s. This would allow cross-L2 transfers to happen without needing to pay L1 gas per transfer, and without needing liquidity-provider-based techniques like ERC-7683.

    Synchronous composability: allow synchronous calls to happen either between a specific L2 and L1, or between multiple L2s. This could be helpful in improving financial efficiency of defi protocols. The former could be done without any cross-L2 coordination; the latter would require shared sequencing. Based rollups are automatically friendly to all of these techniques.

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    Many of the examples above face standard dilemmas of when to standardize and what layers to standardize. If you standardize too early, you risk entrenching an inferior solution. If you standardize too late, you risk creating needless fragmentation. In some cases, there is both a short-term solution that has weaker properties but is easier to implement, and a long-term solution that is "ultimately right" but will take quite a few years to get there.

    One way in which this section is unique, is that these tasks are not just technical problems: they are also (perhaps even primarily!) social problems. They require L2s and wallets and L1 to cooperate. Our ability to handle this problem successfully is a test of our ability to stick together as a community.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    Most of these proposals are "higher-layer" constructions, and so do not greatly affect L1 considerations. One exception is shared sequencing, which has heavy impacts on MEV.


    Scaling execution on L1
    What problem are we solving?
    If L2s become very scalable and successful but L1 remains capable of processing only a very low volume of transactions, there are many risks to Ethereum that might arise:

    The economic situation of ETH the asset becomes more risky, which in turn affects long-run security of the network.
    Many L2s benefit from being closely tied to a highly developed financial ecosystem on L1, and if this ecosystem greatly weakens, the incentive to become an L2 (instead of being an independent L1) weakens
    It will take a long time before L2s have exactly the same security assurances as L1.
    If an L2 fails (eg. due to a malicious or disappearing operator), users would still need to go through L1 in order to recover their assets. Hence, L1 needs to be powerful enough to be able to at least occasionally actually handle a highly complex and chaotic wind-down of an L2.
    For these reasons, it is valuable to continue scaling L1 itself, and making sure that it can continue to accommodate a growing number of uses.

    What is it and how does it work?
    The easiest way to scale is to simply increase the gas limit. However, this risks centralizing the L1, and thus weakening the other important property that makes the Ethereum L1 so powerful: its credibility as a robust base layer. There is an ongoing debate about what degree of simple gas limit increase is sustainable, and this also changes based on which other technologies get implemented to make larger blocks easier to verify (eg. history expiry, statelessness, L1 EVM validity proofs). Another important thing to keep improving is simply the efficiency of Ethereum client software, which is far more optimized today than it was five years ago. An effective L1 gas limit increase strategy would involve accelerating these verification technologies.

    Another scaling strategy involves identifying specific features and types of computation that can be made cheaper without harming the decentralization of the network or its security properties. Examples of this include:

    EOF - a new EVM bytecode format that is more friendly to static analysis, allowing for faster implementations. EOF bytecode could be given lower gas costs to take these efficiencies into account.
    Multidimensional gas pricing - establishing separate basefees and limits for computation, data and storage can increase the Ethereum L1's average capacity without increasing its maximum capacity (and hence creating new security risks).
    Reduce gas costs of specific opcodes and precompiles - historically, we have had several rounds of increasing gas costs for certain operations that were underpriced in order to avoid denial of service attacks. What we have had less of, and could do much more, is reducing gas costs for operations that are overpriced. For example, addition is much cheaper than multiplication, but the costs of the ADD and MUL opcodes are currently the same. We could make ADD cheaper, and even simpler opcodes such as PUSH even cheaper.
    EVM-MAX and SIMD: EVM-MAX ("modular arithmetic extensions") is a proposal to allow more efficient native big-number modular math as a separate module of the EVM. Values computed by EVM-MAX computations would only be accessible by other EVM-MAX opcodes, unless deliberately exported; this allows greater room to store these values in optimized formats. SIMD ("single instruction multiple data") is a proposal to allow efficiently executing the same instruction on an array of values. The two together can create a powerful coprocessor alongside the EVM that could be used to much more efficiently implement cryptographic operations. This would be especially useful for privacy protocols, and for L2 proof systems, so it would help both L1 and L2 scaling.
    These improvements will be discussed in more detail in a future post on the Splurge.

    Finally, a third strategy is native rollups (or "enshrined rollups"): essentially, creating many copies of the EVM that run in parallel, leading to a model that is equivalent to what rollups can provide, but much more natively integrated into the protocol.

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    There are three strategies for L1 scaling, which can be pursued individually or in parallel:

    Improve technology (eg. client code, stateless clients, history expiry) to make the L1 easier to verify, and then raise the gas limit
    Make specific operations cheaper, increasing average capacity without increasing worst-case risks
    Native rollups (ie. "create N parallel copies of the EVM", though potentially giving developers a lot of flexibility in the parameters of the copies they deploy)
    It's worth understanding that these are different techniques that have different tradeoffs. For example, native rollups have many of the same weaknesses in composability as regular rollups: you cannot send a single transaction that synchronously performs operations across many of them, like you can with contracts on the same L1 (or L2). Raising the gas limit takes away from other benefits that can be achieved by making the L1 easier to verify, such as increasing the portion of users that run verifying nodes, and increasing solo stakers. Making specific operations in the EVM cheaper, depending on how it's done, can increase total EVM complexity.

    A big question that any L1 scaling roadmap needs to answer is: what is the ultimate vision for what belongs on L1 and what belongs on L2? Clearly, it's absurd for everything to go on L1: the potential use cases go into the hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, and that would make the L1 completely unviable to verify (unless we go the native rollup route). But we do need some guiding principle, so that we can make sure that we are not creating a situation where we increase the gas limit 10x, heavily damage the Ethereum L1's decentralization, and find that we've only gotten to a world where instead of 99% of activity being on L2, 90% of activity is on L2, and so the result otherwise looks almost the same, except for an irreversible loss of much of what makes Ethereum L1 special.

    One proposed view of a "division of labor" between L1 and L2s, source.How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    Bringing more users onto L1 implies improving not just scale, but also other aspects of L1. It means that more MEV will remain on L1 (as opposed to becoming a problem just for L2s), and so will be even more of a pressing need to handle it explicitly. It greatly increases the value of having fast slot times on L1. And it's also heavily dependent on verification of L1 ("the Verge") going well.


  - Blog Tittle: "Possible futures of the Ethereum protocol, part 1: The Merge"
    Special thanks to Justin Drake, Hsiao-wei Wang, @antonttc, Anders Elowsson and Francesco for feedback and review.

    Originally, "the Merge" referred to the most important event in the Ethereum protocol's history since its launch: the long-awaited and hard-earned transition from proof of work to proof of stake. Today, Ethereum has been a stably running proof of stake system for almost exactly two years, and this proof of stake has performed remarkably well in stability, performance and avoiding centralization risks. However, there still remain some important areas in which proof of stake needs to improve.

    My roadmap diagram from 2023 separated this out into buckets: improving technical features such as stability, performance, and accessibility to smaller validators, and economic changes to address centralization risks. The former got to take over the heading for "the Merge", and the latter became part of "the Scourge".

    The Merge, 2023 roadmap edition.This post will focus on the "Merge" part: what can still be improved in the technical design of proof of stake, and what are some paths to getting there?

    This is not meant as an exhaustive list of things that could be done to proof of stake; rather, it is a list of ideas that are actively being considered.


    The Merge: key goals
    Single slot finality
    Transaction confirmation and finalization as fast as possible, while preserving decentralization
    Improve staking viability for solo stakers
    Improve robustness
    Improve Ethereum's ability to resist and recover from 51% attacks (including finality reversion, finality blocking, and censorship)

    Single slot finality and staking democratization
    What problem are we solving?
    Today, it takes 2-3 epochs (~15 min) to finalize a block, and 32 ETH is required to be a staker. This was originally a compromise meant to balance between three goals:

    Maximizing the number of validators that can participate in staking (this directly implies minimizing the min ETH required to stake)
    Minimizing the time to finality
    Minimizing the overhead of running a node, in this case the cost of downloading, verifying and re-broadcasting all the other validator's signatures
    The three goals are in conflict: in order for economic finality to be possible (meaning: an attacker would need to burn a large amount of ETH to revert a finalized block), you need every single validator to sign two messages each time finality happens. And so if you have many validators, either you need a long time to process all their signatures, or you need very beefy nodes to process all the signatures at the same time.


    Note that this is all conditional on a key goal of Ethereum: ensuring that even successful attacks have a high cost to the attacker. This is what is meant by the term "economic finality". If we did not have this goal, then we could solve this problem by randomly selecting a committee to finalize each slot. Chains that do not attempt to achieve economic finality, such as Algorand, often do exactly this. But the problem with this approach is that if an attacker does control 51% of validators, then they can perform an attack (reverting a finalized block, or censoring, or delaying finality) at very low cost: only the portion of their nodes that are in the committee could be detected as participating in the attack and penalized, whether through slashing or socially-coordinated soft fork. This means that an attacker could repeatedly attack the chain many times over, losing only a small portion of their stake during each attack. Hence, if we want economic finality, a naive committee-based approach does not work, and it appears at first glance that we do need the full set of validators to participate.

    Ideally, we want to preserve economic finality, while simultaneously improving on the status quo in two areas:

    Finalize blocks in one slot (ideally, keep or even reduce the current length of 12s), instead of 15 min
    Allow validators to stake with 1 ETH (down from 32 ETH)
    The first goal is justified by two goals, both of which can be viewed as "bringing Ethereum's properties in line with those of (more centralized) performance-focused L1 chains".

    First, it ensures that all Ethereum users actually benefit from the higher level of security assurances achieved through the finality mechanism. Today, most users do not, because they are not willing to wait 15 minutes; with single-slot finality, users will see their transactions finalized almost as soon as they are confirmed. Second, it simplifies the protocol and surrounding infrastructure if users and applications don't have to worry about the possibility of the chain reverting except in the relatively rare case of an inactivity leak.

    The second goal is justified by a desire to support solo stakers. Poll after poll repeatedly show that the main factor preventing more people from solo staking is the 32 ETH minimum. Reducing the minimum to 1 ETH would solve this issue, to the point where other concerns become the dominant factor limiting solo staking.	


    There is a challenge: the goals of faster finality and more democratized staking both conflict with the goal of minimizing overhead. And indeed, this fact is the entire reason why we did not start with single-slot finality to begin with. However, more recent research presents a few possible paths around the problem.

    What is it and how does it work?
    Single-slot finality involves using a consensus algorithm that finalizes blocks in one slot. This in itself is not a difficult goal: plenty of algorithms, such as Tendermint consensus, already do this with optimal properties. One desired property unique to Ethereum, which Tendermint does not support, is inactivity leaks, which allow the chain to keep going and eventually recover even when more than 1/3 of validators go offline. Fortunately, this desire has already been addressed: there are already proposals that modify Tendermint-style consensus to accommodate inactivity leaks.

    A leading single slot finality proposal


    The harder part of the problem is figuring out how to make single-slot finality work with a very high validator count, without leading to extremely high node-operator overhead. For this, there are a few leading solutions:

    Option 1: Brute force - work hard on implementing better signatures aggregation protocols, potentially using ZK-SNARKs, which would actually allow us to process signatures from millions of validators in each slot.

    Horn, one of the proposed designs for a better aggregation protocol.Option 2: Orbit committees - a new mechanism which allows a randomly-selected medium-sized committee to be responsible for finalizing the chain, but in a way that preserves the cost-of-attack properties that we are looking for.

    One way to think about Orbit SSF is that it opens up a space of compromise options along a spectrum from x=0 (Algorand-style committees, no economic finality) to x=1 (status quo Ethereum), opening up points in the middle where Ethereum still has enough economic finality to be extremely secure, but at the same time we get the efficiency benefits of only needing a medium-sized random sample of validators to participate in each slot.Orbit takes advantage of pre-existing heterogeneity in validator deposit sizes to get as much economic finality as possible, will still giving small validators a proportionate role. In addition, Orbit uses slow committee rotation to ensure high overlap between adjacent quorums, ensuring that its economic finality still applies at committee-switching boundaries.

    Option 3: two-tiered staking - a mechanism where there are two classes of stakers, one with higher deposit requirements and one with lower deposit requirements. Only the higher-deposit tier would be directly involved in providing economic finality. There are various proposals (eg. see the Rainbow staking post) for exactly what rights and responsibilities the lower-deposit tier has. Common ideas include:

    the right to delegate stake to a higher-tier staker
    a random sample of lower-tier stakers attesting to, and being needed to finalize, each block
    the right to generate inclusion lists

    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    There are four major possible paths to take (and we can also take hybrid paths):

    Maintain status quo
    Brute-force SSF
    Orbit SSF
    SSF with two-tiered staking
    (1) means doing no work and leaving staking as is, but it leaves Ethereum's security experience and staking centralization properties worse than it could be.

    (2) brute-forces the problem with high tech. Making this happen requires aggregating a very large number of signatures (1 million+) in a very short period of time (5-10s). One way to think of this approach is that it involves minimizing systemic complexity by going all-out on accepting encapsulated complexity.

    (3) avoids "high tech", and solves the problem with clever rethinking around protocol assumptions: we relax the "economic finality" requirement so that we require attacks to be expensive, but are okay with the cost of attack being perhaps 10x less than today (eg. $2.5 billion cost of attack instead of $25 billion). It's a common view that Ethereum today has far more economic finality than it needs, and its main security risks are elsewhere, and so this is arguably an okay sacrifice to make.

    The main work to do is verifying that the Orbit mechanism is safe and has the properties that we want, and then fully formalizing and implementing it. Additionally, EIP-7251 (increase max effective balance) allows for voluntary validator balance consolidation that immediately reduces the chain verification overhead somewhat, and acts as an effective initial stage for an Orbit rollout.

    (4) avoids clever rethinking and high tech, but it does create a two-tiered staking system which still has centralization risks. The risks depend heavily on the specific rights that the lower staking tier gets. For example:

    If a low-tier staker needs to delegate their attesting rights to a high-tier staker, then delegation could centralize and we would thus end up with two highly centralized tiers of staking.
    If a random sample of the lower tier is needed to approve each block, then an attacker could spend a very small amount of ETH to block finality.
    If lower-tier stakers can only make inclusion lists, then the attestation layer may remain centralized, at which point a 51% attack on the attestation layer can censor the inclusion lists themselves.
    Multiple strategies can be combined, for example:

    (1 + 2): use brute-force techniques to reduce the min deposit size without doing single slot finality. The amount of aggregation required is 64x less than in the pure (3) case, so the problem becomes easier.

    (1 + 3): add Orbit without doing single slot finality

    (2 + 3): do Orbit SSF with conservative parameters (eg. 128k validator committee instead of 8k or 32k), and use brute-force techniques to make that ultra-efficient.

    (1 + 4): add rainbow staking without doing single slot finality

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    In addition to its other benefits, single slot finality reduces the risk of certain types of multi-block MEV attacks. Additionally, attester-proposer separation designs and other in-protocol block production pipelines would need to be designed differently in a single-slot finality world.

    Brute-force strategies have the weakness that they make it harder to reduce slot times.


    Single secret leader election
    What problem are we solving?
    Today, which validator is going to propose the next block is known ahead of time. This creates a security vulnerability: an attacker can watch the network, identify which validators correspond to which IP addresses, and DoS attack each validator right when they are about to propose a block.

    What is it and how does it work?
    The best way to fix the DoS issue is to hide the information about which validator is going to produce the next block, at least until the moment when the block is actually produced. Note that this is easy if we remove the "single" requirement: one solution is to let anyone create the next block, but require the randao reveal to be less than 2256 / N. On average, only one validator would be able to meet this requirement - but sometimes there would be two or more and sometimes there would be zero. Combining the "secrecy" requirement with the "single" requirement" has long been the hard problem.

    Single secret leader election protocols solve this by using some cryptographic techniques to create a "blinded" validator ID for each validator, and then giving many proposers the opportunity to shuffle-and-reblind the pool of blinded IDs (this is similar to how a mixnet works). During each slot, a random blinded ID is selected. Only the owner of that blinded ID is able to generate a valid proof to propose the block, but no one else knows which validator that blinded ID corresponds to.

    Simplified SSLE using ring signatures: https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-ssle/12315
    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    Realistically, what's left is finding and implementing a protocol that is sufficiently simple that we are comfortable implementing it on mainnet. We highly value Ethereum being a reasonably simple protocol, and we do not want complexity to increase further. SSLE implementations that we've seen add hundreds of lines of spec code, and introduce new assumptions in complicated cryptography. Figuring out an efficient-enough quantum-resistant SSLE implementation is also an open problem.

    It may end up the case that the extra complexity introduced by SSLE only goes down enough once we take the plunge and introduce the machinery to do general-purpose zero-knowledge proofs into the Ethereum protocol at L1 for other reasons (eg. state trees, ZK-EVM).

    An alternative option is to simply not bother with SSLE, and use out-of-protocol mitigations (eg. at the p2p layer) to solve the DoS issues.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    If we add an attester-proposer separation (APS) mechanism, eg. execution tickets, then execution blocks (ie. blocks containing Ethereum transactions) will not need SSLE, because we could rely on block builders being specialized. However, we would still benefit from SSLE for consensus blocks (ie. blocks containing protocol messages such as attestations, perhaps pieces of inclusion lists, etc).


    Faster transaction confirmations
    What problem are we solving?
    There is value in Ethereum's transaction confirmation time decreasing further, from 12 seconds down to eg. 4 seconds. Doing this would significantly improve the user experience of both the L1 and based rollups, while making defi protocols more efficient. It would also make it easier for L2s to decentralize, because it would allow a large class of L2 applications to work on based rollups, reducing the demand for L2s to build their own committee-based decentralized sequencing.

    What is it and how does it work?
    There are broadly two families of techniques here:

    Reduce slot times, down to eg. 8 seconds or 4 seconds. This does not necessarily have to mean 4-second finality: finality inherently takes three rounds of communication, and so we can make each round of communication be a separate block, which would after 4 seconds get at least a preliminary confirmation.
    Allow proposers to publish pre-confirmations over the course of a slot. In the extreme, a proposer could include transactions that they see into their block in real time, and immediately publish a pre-confirmation message for each transaction ("My first transaction is 0√ó1234...", "My second transaction is 0√ó5678..."). The case of a proposer publishing two conflicting confirmations can be dealt with in two ways: (i) by slashing the proposer, or (ii) by using attesters to vote on which one came earlier.
    What are some links to existing research?
    Based preconfirmations: https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations/17353
    Protocol-enforced proposer commitments (PEPC): https://ethresear.ch/t/unbundling-pbs-towards-protocol-enforced-proposer-commitments-pepc/13879
    Staggered periods across parallel chains (a 2018-era idea for achieving low latency): https://ethresear.ch/t/staggered-periods/1793
    What is left to do, and what are the tradeoffs?
    It's far from clear just how practical it is to reduce slot times. Even today, stakers in many regions of the world have a hard time getting attestations included fast enough. Attempting 4-second slot times runs the risk of centralizing the validator set, and making it impractical to be a validator outside of a few privileged geographies due to latency. Specifically, moving to 4-second slot times would require reducing the bound on network latency ("delta") to two seconds.

    The proposer preconfirmation approach has the weakness that it can greatly improve average-case inclusion times, but not worst-case: if the current proposer is well-functioning, your transaction will be pre-confirmed in 0.5 seconds instead of being included in (on average) 6 seconds, but if the current proposer is offline or not well-functioning, you would still have to wait up to a full 12 seconds for the next slot to start and provide a new proposer.

    Additionally, there is the open question of how pre-confirmations will be incentivized. Proposers have an incentive to maximize their optionality as long as possible. If attesters sign off on timeliness of pre-confirmations, then transaction senders could make a portion of the fee conditional on an immediate pre-confirmation, but this would put an extra burden on attesters, and potentially make it more difficult for attesters to continue functioning as a neutral "dumb pipe".

    On the other hand, if we do not attempt this and keep finality times at 12 seconds (or longer), the ecosystem will put greater weight on pre-confirmation mechanisms made by layer 2s, and cross-layer-2 interaction will take longer.

    How does it interact with other parts of the roadmap?
    Proposer-based preconfirmations realistically depend on an attester-proposer separation (APS) mechanism, eg. execution tickets. Otherwise, the pressure to provide real-time preconfirmations may be too centralizing for regular validators.

    Exactly how short slot times can be also depends on the slot structure, which depends heavily on what versions of APS, inclusion lists, etc we end up implementing. There are slot structures that contain fewer rounds and are thus more friendly to short slot times, but they make tradeoffs in other places.


    Other research areas
    51% attack recovery
    There is often an assumption that if a 51% attack happens (including attacks that are not cryptographically provable, such as censorship), the community will come together to implement a minority soft fork that ensures that the good guys win, and the bad guys get inactivity-leaked or slashed. However, this degree of over-reliance on the social layer is arguably unhealthy. We can try to reduce reliance on the social layer, by making the process of recovering as automated as possible.

    Full automation is impossible, because if it were, that would count as a >50% fault tolerant consensus algorithm, and we already know the (very restrictive) mathematically provable limitations of those kinds of algorithms. But we can achieve partial automation: for example, a client could automatically refuse to accept a chain as finalized, or even as the head of the fork choice, if it censors transactions that the client has seen for long enough. A key goal would be ensuring that the bad guys in an attack at least cannot get a quick clean victory.

    Increasing the quorum threshold
    Today, a block finalizes if 67% of stakers support it. There is an argument that this is overly aggressive. There has been only one (very brief) finality failure in all of Ethereum's history. If this percentage is increased, eg. to 80%, then the added number of non-finality periods will be relatively low, but Ethereum would gain security properties: in particular, many more contentious situations will result in temporary stopping of finality. This seems a much healthier situation than "the wrong side" getting an instant victory, both when the wrong side is an attacker, and when it's a client that has a bug.

    This also gives an answer to the question "what is the point of solo stakers"? Today, most stakers are already staking through pools, and it seems very unlikely to get solo stakers up to 51% of staked ETH. However, getting solo stakers up to a quorum-blocking minority, especially if the quorum is 80% (so a quorum-blocking minority would only need 21%) seems potentially achievable if we work hard at it. As long as solo stakers do not go along with a 51% attack (whether finality-reversion or censorship), such an attack would not get a "clean victory", and solo stakers would be motivated to help organize a minority soft fork.

    Note that there are interactions between quorum thresholds and the Orbit mechanism: if we end up using Orbit, then what exactly "21% of stakers" means will become a more complicated question, and will depend in part on the distribution of validators.

    Quantum-resistance
    Metaculus currently believes, though with wide error bars, that quantum computers will likely start breaking cryptography some time in the 2030s:Quantum computing experts such as Scott Aaronson have also recently started taking the possibility of quantum computers actually working in the medium term much more seriously. This has consequences across the entire Ethereum roadmap: it means that each piece of the Ethereum protocol that currently depends on elliptic curves will need to have some hash-based or otherwise quantum-resistant replacement. This particularly means that we cannot assume that we will be able to lean on the excellent properties of BLS aggregation to process signatures from a large validator set forever. This justifies conservatism in the assumptions around performance of proof-of-stake designs, and also is a cause to be more proactive to develop quantum-resistant alternatives.

  - Blog Tittle: "Making Ethereum alignment legible"
    One of the most important social challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem is balancing - or, more accurately, integrating, decentralization and cooperation. The ecosystem's strength is that there is a wide array of people and organizations - client teams, researchers, layer 2 teams, application developers, local community groups - all building toward their own visions of what Ethereum can be. The primary challenge is making sure that all these projects are, collectively, building something that feels like one Ethereum ecosystem, and not 138 incompatible fiefdoms.

    To solve this challenge, many people throughout the Ethereum ecosystem have brought up the concept of "Ethereum alignment". This can include values alignment (eg. be open source, minimize centralization, support public goods), technological alignment (eg. work with ecosystem-wide standards), and economic alignment (eg. use ETH as a token where possible). However, the concept has historically been poorly defined, and this creates risk of social layer capture: if alignment means having the right friends, then "alignment" as a concept has failed.

    To solve this, I would argue that the concept of alignment should be made more legible, decomposed into specific properties, which can be represented by specific metrics. Each person's list will be different, and metrics will inevitably change over time. However, I think we already have some solid starting points.Open source - this is valuable for two reasons: (i) code being inspectable to ensure security, and more importantly (ii) reducing the risk of proprietary lockin and enabling permissionless third-party improvements. Not every piece of every application needs to be fully open source, but core infrastructure components that the ecosystem depends on absolutely should be. The gold standard here is the FSF free software definition and OSI open source definition.
    Open standards - striving for interoperability with the Ethereum ecosystem and building on open standards, both the ones that exist (eg. ERC-20, ERC-1271...) and those that are under development (eg. account abstraction, cross-L2 transfers, L1 and L2 light client proofs, upcoming address format standards). If you want to introduce a new feature that is not well-served by existing standards, write a new ERC in collaboration with others. Applications and wallets can be rated by which ERCs they are compatible with.
    Decentralization and security - avoiding points of trust, minimizing censorship vulnerabilities, and minimizing centralized infrastructure dependency. The natural metrics are (i) the walkaway test: if your team and servers disappear tomorrow, will your application still be usable, and (ii) the insider attack test: if your team itself tries to attack the system, how much will break, and how much harm could you do? An important formalization is the L2beat rollup stages.
    Positive-sum
    Toward Ethereum - the project succeeding should benefit the whole Ethereum community (eg. ETH holders, Ethereum users), even if they are not part of the project's own ecosystem. Specific examples include using ETH as the token (and thus contributing to its network effect), contributions to open source technology, and commitments to donate a % of tokens or revenue to Ethereum ecosystem-wide public goods.
    Toward the broader world - Ethereum is here to make the world a more free and open place, enable new forms of ownership and collaboration, and contribute positively to important challenges facing humanity. Does your project do this? Examples include applications that bring sustainable value to broader audiences (eg. financial inclusion), % donations to beyond-Ethereum public goods, and building technology with utility beyond crypto (eg. funding mechanisms, general computer security) that actually gets used in those contexts.
    Ethereum node map, source ethernodes.orgObviously, not all of the above is applicable to each project. The metrics that make sense for L2s, wallets, decentralized social media applications, etc, are all going to look very different. Different metrics may also change in priority: two years ago, rollups having "training wheels" was more okay because it was "early days"; today, we need to move to at least stage 1 ASAP. Today, the most legible metric for being positive sum is commitments to donate a percentage of tokens, which more and more projects are doing; tomorrow we can find metrics to make other aspects of positive-sumness legible too.

    My ideal goal here is that we see more entities like L2beat emerging to track how well individual projects are meeting the above criteria, and other criteria that the community comes up with. Instead of competing to have the right friends, projects would compete to be as aligned as possible according to clearly understandable criteria. The Ethereum Foundation should remain one-step-removed from most of this: we fund L2beat, but we should not be L2beat. Making the next L2beat is itself a permissionless process.

    This would also give the EF, and other organizations (and individuals) interested in supporting and engaging with the ecosystem while keeping their neutrality, a clearer route to determine which projects to support and use. Each organization and individual can make their own judgement about which criteria they care about the most, and choose projects in part based on which ones best fit those criteria. This makes it easier for both the EF and everyone else to become part of the incentive for projects to be more aligned.

    You can only be a meritocracy if merit is defined; otherwise, you have a (likely exclusive and negative-sum) social game. Concerns about "who watches the watchers" are best addressed not by betting everything on an attempt to make sure everyone in positions of influence is an angel, but through time-worn techniques like separation of powers. "Dashboard organizations" like L2beat, block explorers, and other ecosystem monitors are an excellent example of such a principle working in the Ethereum ecosystem today. If we do more to make different aspects of alignment legible, while not centralizing in one single "watcher", we can make the concept much more effective, and fair and inclusive in the way that the Ethereum ecosystem strives to be.

  - Blog Tittle: "Glue and coprocessor architectures"
    Special thanks to Justin Drake, Georgios Konstantopoulos, Andrej Karpathy, Michael Gao, Tarun Chitra and various Flashbots contributors for feedback and review.

    If you analyze any resource-intensive computation being done in the modern world in even a medium amount of detail, one feature that you will find again and again is that the computation can be broken up into two parts:

    A relatively small amount of complex, but not very computationally intensive, "business logic"
    A large amount of intensive, but highly structured, "expensive work"
    These two forms of computation are best handled in different ways: the former, with an architecture that may have lower efficiency but needs to have very high generality, and the latter, with an architecture that may have lower generality, but needs to have very high efficiency.

    What are some examples of this separation in practice?
    To start off, let us look under the hood of the environment I am most familiar with: the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Here is the geth debug trace of a recent Ethereum transaction that I did: updating the IPFS hash of my blog on ENS. The transaction consumes a total of 46924 gas, which can be categorized in this way:

    Base cost: 21,000
    Calldata: 1,556
    EVM execution: 24,368
    SLOAD opcode: 6,400
    SSTORE opcode: 10,100
    LOG opcode: 2,149
    Other: 6,719

    EVM trace of an ENS hash update. Second last column is gas consumption.The moral of the story is: most of the execution (~73% if you look at the EVM alone, ~85% if you include the portion of the base cost that covers computation) is concentrated in a very small number of structured expensive operations: storage reads and writes, logs, and cryptography (the base cost includes 3000 to pay for signature verification, and the EVM also includes 272 to pay for hashing). The rest of the execution is "business logic": fiddling around with the bits of the calldata to extract the ID of the record I am trying to set and the hash I am setting it to, and so on. In a token transfer, this would include adding and subtracting balances, in a more advanced application, this might include a loop, and so on.

    In the EVM, these two forms of execution are handled in different ways. The high-level business logic is written in a higher-level language, often Solidity, which compiles to the EVM. The expensive work is still triggered by EVM opcodes (SLOAD, etc), but > 99% of the actual computation is done in specialized modules written directly inside of client code (or even libraries).

    To reinforce our understanding of this pattern, let's explore it in another context: AI code written in python using torch.


    Forward pass of one block of a transformer model, source.What do we see here? We see a relatively small amount of "business logic", written in python, which describes the structure of the operations that are being done. In an actual application, there will also be another type of business logic, which determines details like how you get the input and what you do to the output. But, if we peek into each of the individual operations themselves (self.norm, torch.cat, +, *, the various steps inside self.attn...), we see vectorized computation: the same operation getting computed on a large number of values in parallel. Similarly to the first example, a small portion of the compute is spent on business logic, and the bulk of the compute is spent on performing the big structured matrix and vector operations - in fact, the majority is just matrix multiplication.

    Just like in the EVM example, the two types of work are handled in two different ways. The high-level business logic code is written in Python, a highly general and flexible language which is also very slow, and we just accept the inefficiency because it only touches a small part of the total computational cost. Meanwhile, the intensive operations are written in highly optimized code, often CUDA code running on a GPU. Increasingly, we're even starting to see LLM inference being done on ASICs.

    Modern programmable cryptography, such as SNARKs, follows a similar pattern yet again, on two levels. First, the prover can be written in a high-level language where the heavy work is done with vectorized operations, just like the AI example above. My circle STARK code here shows this in action. Second, the program that is being executed inside the cryptography can itself be written in a way that is split between generalized business logic and highly structured expensive work.

    To see how this works, we can look at one of the latest trends in STARK proving. To be general-purpose and easy to use, teams are increasingly building STARK provers for widely-adopted minimal virtual machines, such as RISC-V. Any program whose execution needs to be proven can be compiled into RISC-V, and then the prover can prove the RISC-V execution of that code.


    Diagram from RiscZero documentationThis is super convenient: it means that we only need to write the prover logic once, and from that point forward any program that needs to be proven can just be written in any "conventional" programming language (eg. RiskZero supports Rust). However, there is a problem: this approach incurs significant overhead. Programmable cryptography is already very expensive; adding the overhead of running code inside a RISC-V interpreter is too much. And so developers have come up with a hack: you identify the specific expensive operations that make up the bulk of the computation (often that's hashes and signatures), and you create specialized modules to prove those operations extremely efficiently. And then you just combine the inefficient-but-general RISC-V proving system and the efficient-but-specialized proving systems together, and you get the best of both worlds.

    Programmable cryptography other than ZK-SNARKs, such as multi-party computation (MPC) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) will likely be optimized using a similar approach.

    What is the general pattern at play?
    Modern computation is increasingly following what I call a glue and coprocessor architecture: you have some central "glue" component, which has high generality but low efficiency, which is responsible for shuttling data between one or more coprocessor components, which have low generality but high efficiency.This is a simplification: in practice, there are almost always more than two levels along the tradeoff curve between efficiency and generality. GPUs, and other chips that are often called "coprocessors" in industry, are less general than CPUs but more general than ASICs. There are complicated tradeoffs of how far to specialize, which are decided based on projections and intuitions about what parts of an algorithm will still be the same in five years, and which parts will change in six months. In a ZK-proving architecture, we often similarly see multiple layers of specialization. But for a broad mental model, it's sufficient to think about two levels. There are parallels to this in many domains of computation:Domain	Glue	Coprocessor
    Ethereum	EVM	Dedicated opcodes/precompiles for specialized operations
    AI (eg. LLMs)	Python (often)	GPU via CUDA; ASICs
    Web apps	Javascript	WASM
    Programmable cryptography	RISC-V	Specialized modules (eg. for hashes and signatures)


    From the above examples, it might feel like a law of nature that of course computation can be split in this way. And indeed, you can find examples of specialization in computing for decades. However, I would argue that this separation is increasing. I think this is true for a few key reasons:

    We have only relatively recently hit the limits of increasing CPU clock speed, and so further gains can only come from parallelization. However, parallelization is hard to reason about, and so it's often more practical for developers to continue reasoning sequentially, and let the parallelization happen in the backend, wrapped inside specialized modules built for specific operations.
    Computation has only recently become so fast that the computational costs of business logic have become truly negligible. In this world, it makes sense to optimize the VM that business logic runs in for goals other than compute efficiency: developer friendliness, familiarity, security, and other similar objectives. Meanwhile, the specialized "coprocessor" modules can continue to be designed for efficiency, and get their security and developer friendliness properties from the relatively simple "interface" that they have with the glue.
    It's becoming clearer what the most important expensive operations are. This is most obvious in cryptography, where it's clear what kinds of specific expensive operations are most likely to be used: modular arithmetic, elliptic curve linear combinations (aka multi-scalar multiplications), Fast Fourier transforms, and so on. It's also becoming clearer in AI, where the bulk of computation has been "mostly matrix multiplication" (albeit with different levels of precision) for over two decades. Similar trends appear in other domains. There are just much fewer unknown unknowns in (computationally intensive) computing than there were 20 years ago.
    What does this imply?
    A key takeaway is that glue should optimize for being good glue, and coprocessors should optimize for being good coprocessors. We can explore the implications of this in a few key areas.

    EVM
    Blockchain virtual machines (eg. EVM) don't need to be efficient, they just need to be familiar. Computation in an inefficient VM can be made almost as efficient in practice as computation in a natively efficient VM by just adding the right coprocessors (aka "precompiles"). The overhead incurred by eg. the EVM's 256-bit registers is relatively small, while the benefits from the EVM's familiarity and existing developer ecosystem are great and durable. Developer teams optimizing the EVM are even finding that lack of parallelization is often not a primary barrier to scalability.

    The best ways to improve the EVM may well just be (i) adding better precompiles or specialized opcodes, eg. some combination of EVM-MAX and SIMD may be justified, and (ii) improving the storage layout, which eg. the Verkle tree changes do as a side effect by greatly reducing the cost of accessing storage slots that are beside each other.


    Storage optimizations in the Ethereum Verkle tree proposal, putting adjacent storage keys together and adjusting gas costs to reflect this. Optimizations like this, together with better precompiles, may well matter more than tweaking the EVM itself.Secure computing and open hardware
    One of the big challenges with improving security of modern computing at the hardware layer is the overcomplicated and proprietary nature of it: chips are designed to be highly efficient, which requires proprietary optimizations. Backdoors are easy to hide, and side channel vulnerabilities keep getting discovered.

    There continues to be a valiant effort to push more open and more secure alternatives from multiple angles. Some computations are increasingly done in trusted execution environments, including on users' phones, and this has increased security for users already. The push toward more-open-source consumer hardware continues, with recent victories like a RISC-V laptop running Ubuntu.


    RISC-V laptop running Debian, sourceHowever, efficiency continues to be a problem. The author of the above-linked article writes:

    It's unfeasible for a newer, open-source chip design like RISC-V to go toe to toe with processor technologies that have been around for and refined for decades. Progress has a starting point.

    More paranoid ideas, like this design for building a RISC-V computer on top of an FPGA, face even more overhead. But what if glue and coprocessor architectures mean that this overhead does not actually matter? What if we accept that open and secure chips will be be slower than proprietary chips, if needed even giving up on common optimizations like speculative execution and branch prediction, but try to compensate for this by adding (if needed, proprietary) ASIC modules for specific types of computation that are the most intensive? Sensitive computations can be done in a "main chip" that would be optimized for security, open source design and side-channel resistance. More intensive computations (eg. ZK-proving, AI) would be done in the ASIC modules, which would learn less information (potentially, with cryptographic blinding, perhaps in some cases even zero information) about the computation being performed.

    Cryptography
    Another key takeaway is that this is all very optimistic for cryptography, especially programmable cryptography, going mainstream. We're already seeing hyper-optimized implementations of some specific highly structured computations in SNARKs, MPC and other settings: overhead for some hash functions is in the range of being only a few hundred times more expensive than running the computation directly, and extremely low overhead for AI (which is mostly just matrix multiplications) is also possible. Further improvements like GKR will likely reduce this further. Fully general purpose VM execution, especially if executed inside a RISC-V interpreter, will likely continue to have something like ten-thousand-fold overhead, but for the reasons described in this post, this will not matter: as long as the most intensive parts of a computation are handled separately using efficient dedicated techniques, the total overhead will be manageable.


    A simplified diagram of a dedicated MPC for matrix multiplication, the largest component in AI model inference. See this paper for more details, including ways to keep both the model and the input private.One exception to the idea that "glue only needs to be familiar, not efficient" is latency, and to a smaller extent data bandwidth. If a computation involves doing repeated heavy operations on the same data dozens of times (as cryptography and AI both do), any delays that result from an inefficient glue layer can become a primary bottleneck to running time. Hence, glue also has efficiency requirements, though they are more specific ones.

    Conclusion
    On the whole, I consider the above trends to be very positive developments from several perspectives. First, it is the logical way to maximize computing efficiency while preserving developer friendliness, and being able to get more of both at the same time benefits everyone. In particular, by enabling more efficiency gains from specialization on the client side, it improves our ability to run computations that are both sensitive and performance-demanding (eg. ZK-proving, LLM inference) locally on the user's hardware. Second, it creates a large window of opportunity to ensure that the drive for efficiency does not compromise other values, most notably security, openness and simplicity: side-channel security and openness in computer hardware, reducing circuit complexity in ZK-SNARKs, and reducing complexity in virtual machines. Historically, the drive for efficiency has led to these other factors taking a back seat. With glue-and-coprocessor architectures, it no longer needs to. One part of the machine optimizes for efficiency, and the other part optimizes for generality and other values, and the two work together.

    The trend is also very beneficial for cryptography, because cryptography itself is a major example of "expensive structured computation", which gets accelerated by this trend. This adds a further opportunity to increase security. A security increase also becomes possible in the world of blockchains: we can worry less about optimizing virtual machines, and instead focus more on optimizing precompiles and other features that live alongside virtual machines.

    Third, this trend presents an opportunity for smaller and newer players to participate. If computation is becoming less monolithic, and more modular, that greatly decreases the barrier to entry. Even with an ASIC for one type of computation, it's possible to make a difference. The same will be true in the ZK-proving space, and in EVM optimization. Writing code that has near-frontier-level efficiency becomes much easier and more accessible. Auditing and formally verifying such code becomes easier and more accessible. And finally, because these very different domains of computing are converging on some common patterns, there is more room for collaboration and learning between them.
