    We do need better cause prioritization in ethereum core dev.

    Like, if I had to choose between (i) the blob target increase from 3 to 6 and (ii) literally everything else in Pectra, I would choose (i).

    What's the equivalent for Fusaka and G*?

    (Obviously a big part of the answer is: blobs and blobs, though I think L1 EVM improvements are important too, my favorites are EOF -> full AA via 7701 and SIMD+EVMMAX plus moderate gas limit increases)

    We're doing peerdas. Maybe explore more ambitious versions of peerdas eg. https://notes.ethereum.org/NgKvvYiAQ7WdxPECCVdGUQ ?

    Congestion pricing in NYC seems to be working well so far.

    Great example of market mechanisms in action.

  * Tweet:
    Only thing is that I wish the tolls were dynamic. Price uncertainty is better than time uncertainty (paying $10 more today is fine if you pay $10 less tomorrow, but you can't compensate being 30 min late for a flight or meeting by being 30 min early to the next one)

    Thanks for the warm welcome to the family and your work for wild animals!

    I'm happy to be adoptive father to Moo Deng as she grows up over the next 2y and support her with my 10M THB donation, maybe more as I set aside 88 ETH for🦛+ frens. May they live long and prosper🖖🏻

    Deep funding combines two ideas:

    1. Value as a graph: instead of asking "how much did X contribute to humanity?", ask "how much of the credit for Y belongs to X?"
    2. Distilled human judgement: an open market of AIs fills in all the weights, human jury randomly spot-checks them

    https://x.com/TheDevanshMehta/status/1867600164502089925

    (1) has been a growing paradigm recently, for good reason. Contribution is hard to measure in the abstract: if you ask people how much they would pay to save N birds, they answer $80 for N=2000 and N=200000. "Local" questions like "is A or B more valuable to C?" are much more tractable.

    (2) is based on ideas in my info finance post: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/11/09/infofinance.html#info-finance-for-distilled-human-judgement . Anyone can use any methods (eg. AI) to suggest weights for *all* edges, a human jury does detailed analysis on a random subset. The submissions that are most compatible with the jury answers decide the final output.

    ARS/USD is at exactly the same level as it was one year ago.

    Quite an impressive turnaround for a currency that was previously on a seemingly unstoppable road to hyperinflation.

    Inflation rates have also been decreasing quickly in recent months.

    What I would love to see in a wallet:

  * Tweet:
    One part of L2 scaling is Ethereum increasing its blob capacity. The other part is rollups becoming more data-efficient. Good to see 
    @Starknet
    rising to the challenge.

    Would love to see more EVM rollups increasing data efficiency too (see https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#3 )

    An important step.
    Some important next steps:
      * Helios (or alternatives) being integrated into user wallets, on mobile and desktop
      * L2 configs moving onchain (first step: https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/669 )
      * L2 configs including specification of state proof verification rules (a possible starting point: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668 )
    Once those three are done, we get universal L1 and L2 light client verification!

    I appreciate all the memecoins that donate portions of their supply directly to charity.

    (eg. I saw ebull sent a bunch to various groups last month)

    Anything that gets sent to me gets donated to charity too (thanks moodeng! The 10B from today is going to anti-airborne-disease tech), though I truly prefer if you guys send to charity directly, maybe even make a DAO and get your community directly engaged in the decisions and process.

    I've said before that I think the best thing for memecoins is if they can be maximally positive-sum for the world, so it's great to see moments when that actually happens!

    Some thoughts on solo staking, what realistic value solo (+ small-business and community) stakers could provide to the network, and what changes L1 can make to better support solo stakers.

  * Tweet:
    I take this seriously. Starting next year, I plan to only publicly mention (in blogs, talks, etc) L2s that are stage 1+, with *maybe a short grace period* for new genuinely interesting projects.

    It doesn't matter if I invested, or if you're my friend; stage 1 or bust.

    Multiple ZK-rollup teams have told me they're on track to be stage 1 by year end. I'm excited to see that happen!

    Of course we should not throw away training wheels become we're actually confident that the proof systems are secure; that would be irresponsible. But stage 1 (75% threshold on council to override the proof system, 26%+ of council must be outside the rollup team) is a very reasonable moderate milestone. The multisigs I'm in have not had a single liveness failure in years, let alone 26%.

    The era of rollups being glorified multisigs is coming to an end. The era of cryptographic trust is upon us.

  * Tweet:
    BTW the above also applies to L2 tokens or other project tokens I hold (incl not-yet-liquid): all proceeds will be donated, again either to support public goods within the ethereum ecosystem or broader charity (eg. biomedical R&D).

    I also do not intend to invest into L2s or other token projects in the foreseeable future. My goal with giving projects money is to support things that I think are valuable, especially in cases where other parts of the ecosystem might undervalue them. Going forward, I plan to just do this with donations.

  * Tweet:
    This is a good post to poke through if you want more details on "the kinds of things that EF spends money on" (at least as far as grants go; internal teams obviously look different)

  * Tweet:
    Airdrops are a fascinating initial use case for ZK / blockchain-based identity / credential / attestation frameworks. The goals of an airdrop are:

    (i) distribute to community members [and not randos who will all immediately sell]
    (ii) reward contributions to the project
    (iii) be reasonably egalitarian [but some disparity is ok]
    (iv) resist extractive/adversarial farming

    These are exactly the properties that identity / credential / attestation frameworks (eg. see ideas in https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/08/21/plurality.html#8_1 ) are trying to achieve. Hence, for anyone building such frameworks, it makes perfect sense to use token issuance as an initial use case to beta-test and refine their work in an adversarial environment.

  * Tweet:
    One related point is that giving tokens away for free is not the only "form factor" that makes sense for this: you can also do discounted sales.

    I talk about reasons why to do this here:

    https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/08/22/prices.html

    Depending on the degree of membership/contribution you can prove, you can buy a corresponding number of tokens at a reduced price. This helps make the supply more distributed and rewards non-financial contributors, while still ensuring buyers have "skin in the game".

    Any technique that works for airdrops also works for discounts. A related concept (CT 
    @pujaohlhaver
    
    @IdenaNetwork
    ) is to subsidize savings rates for smaller accounts as an alternative to UBI. Singapore's CPF already does something similar.

    Summary of Ethereum block-building research as of 2024-08-07:

    * Everyone agrees that having multiple actors contribute txs that must be included in the block is a good idea
    * Open debate on whether avoiding a "last mover" is possible

    It's good to see the progress! It feels like the block construction topic is nearing a light at the end of the tunnel.

    I think people will be surprised by how quickly "cross-L2 interoperability problems" stop being problems and we get a smooth user experience across the entire ethereum-verse (incl L1, rollups, validiums, even sidechains). I'm seeing lots of energy and will to make this happen.

    One concept I introduced in my recent review of the bitcoin block size war books ( https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/05/31/blocksize.html ) is the one-sided competence trap.

    I'm really proud that ethereum does not have any culture of trying to prevent people from speaking their minds, even when they have very negative feelings toward major things in the protocol or ecosystem.

    Privacy in physical space is rapidly decreasing. Better privacy online is one of the few tools we have to restore a little bit of balance.

    Privacy is normal. Support privacy.

  * Tweet:
    This is bad.

    Crypto is not just about trading tokens, it's part of a broader ethos of protecting freedom and privacy and keeping power in the hands of the little guy.

    And these values unfortunately continue to be under attack, globally.

  * Tweet:
    Privacy is normal.

    Railgun uses the privacy pools protocol ( https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364 ) which makes it much harder for bad actors to join the pool without compromising users' privacy.

    Re-upping my post from 1.5 years ago on "layer 3s":

    https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/09/17/layer_3.html

    The summary is that layer 3s don't magically improve throughput even more, though they can reduce some fixed costs of batch publishing and deposits/withdrawals.

    However, there are other, potentially "lighter", ways to get the same cost savings that you get from L3s.

    Fortunately, the Ethereum ecosystem is already rising to the challenge.

  * Tweet:
    Going beyond scaling, applications that are built today need to be built with "2020s Ethereum" in mind. Here's what this means:

  * Tweet:
    For a long time, the Ethereum ecosystem has been content to develop applications for a relatively small bubble, and high fees were a good reason why we could not go further. Today, no longer. And so, we no longer have an excuse.

  * Tweet:
    Fourth, continue improving on security.

    We need to raise our standards. By the end of the year, I think we should only refer to rollups that are at least stage 1 as "rollups".

    Moving to stage 2 (fully trusting code) is the next step and will require moving carefully.

  * Tweet:
    What does this mean more broadly?

    I argue that now that the merge and EIP-4844 are done, we are decidedly on the right side of the S-curve. Further L1 changes will be quite meaningful and significant, but relatively milder.

  * Tweet:
    Second, optimistic data constructions, both Plasma and other "hybrid data availability" ideas that are designed to maximize security.

    Third, improve on execution-related constraints, both parallelization and storage-related issues.

  * Tweet:
    The Dencun hard fork has activated, and thanks to Blobscriptions the blob fee markets are now in "price discovery mode".

  * Tweet:
    Meanwhile rollups also need to improve, in four key ways.

    First, data compression.

  * Tweet:
    The next step is verifying blobs with PeerDAS, a conservative version of DAS that can offer some additional scaling. At first, we'll likely see some clients full-verifying and others doing DAS checks.

    More and more advanced versions of DAS can be introduced over time.

  * Tweet:
    It has been well-understood for years that the future of Ethereum scaling depends on rollups backed by data space secured with data availability sampling. EIP-4844 is a key change that lays the groundwork for this future.

  * Tweet:
    Ethereum has blobs. Where do we go from here?

  * Tweet:
    Are validators in the same cluster (eg same exchange, same user) more likely than unrelated validators to miss attestations at the same time? If so, can we tweak rewards to favor decentralized staking?

    Possibly yes.

  * Tweet:
    Abolish daylight savings time.

  * Tweet:
    Polymarket is predicting that blobs (~125 kB) will cost ~0.001 ETH.

    Today, 125 kB calldata costs ~30 gwei per gas * 16 gas per byte * 125000 gas ~= 0.06 ETH

    And if you think polymarket's guess that blobs will be 60x cheaper is over-optimistic, you can use the market to hedge!

    One application of AI that I am excited about is AI-assisted formal verification of code and bug finding.

    I'm really looking forward to Verkle trees. They will enable stateless validator clients, which can allow staking nodes to run with near-zero hard disk space and sync nearly instantly - far better solo staking UX. Also good for user-facing light clients.

    * Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't.
