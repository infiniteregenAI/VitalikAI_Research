    A lot of the time when people talk about some of the challenges with crypto one of the answers that people tend to give is people tend to say you know this is still early days right we're still building we're still building out the basic infrastructure you know look how long something like the internet uh took to came into fruition right and this is something that I think people have been saying since uh like basically almost since Bitcoin itself launched and one of the challenges with saying this of course is that today you know we are not in early days anymore right Bitcoin has existed for 15 years ethereum as a project has existed for more than 10 years and uh you know we see things like Chad GPT rising up from not even existing as companies to suddenly completely changing everyone's understanding of what intelligence even is and so you have to ask the question of like well how do we actually even think about this right are we actually early and the way that I answer this question is I think we are not early to crypto but we are early to crypto actually being usable so let me explain what I mean with uh by going a little bit into history so who here remembers back in 2013 when we were all excited about Bitcoin and uh Bitcoin was the next big thing Bitcoin was the next big revolution for payments and people were making these really amazing and really Earnest efforts to try to just get regular Merchants all around the world to start accepting Bitcoin who here remembers room 77 in Berlin anyone here eight there yeah so the one on the right this is Boston it's a restaurant called thonus monkfish that's actually the first Bitcoin restaurant that I want to so back in 2013 you could be a proud Bitcoin accepted here restaurant and also be a proud LGBT Friendly restaurant at the same time and um you know crypto Twitter would not think that there is any contradiction uh so back at the time there was like real genuine excitement about this so what happened well one way to answer this is uh we can look a little bit further and uh the memory that comes to me is this to Argentina that I made in 2021 so this was my first time in Argentina and the first thing that I noticed was that there was this population Countrywide that was not just incredibly excited about crypto but that was actively using it on a massive scale like literally yeah I was walking around on Christmas Day and the first coffee shop that I noticed was open I walked in the owner knew who I was and the owner let me pay an e for the coffee and some dessert that I had with my friends now they were using crypto but they were not using decentralized technology what they what were they using it turns out the Argentinian locals were all using binance to binance transfers why binance to binance transfers are instant and binance to binance transfers are free and this is ultimately the same problem that I think ended up killing at least the original wave of exploration into getting everyone to adopt Bitcoin as a currency it was the fees if you remember the marketing at the very beginning why Bitcoin is great it talks a lot about how Western Union PayPal credit card companies they all just horribly you on fees they charge like incredibly High fees like they're awful right but then Bitcoin itself the fees went up to $50 um ethereum all the fees went up to the highest ever fee that I paid on uh ether was uh actually for a privacy preserving transaction so admittedly the gas went went up and uh you know basically like big parts of Twitter comment every time I do things so privacy protocols have a really good product Market fit and so the transaction feels about $800 so basically the reason why a lot of this stuff failed is fees what's new in 20124 well this is a chart of fees on ethereum lawyer 2s they have gone down from being somewhere between 10 and 50 cents to being under 1 cent basically zero at the same time optimism and arbitrum two major ethereum Lear ones have hit this important security Milestone that's called stage one and multiple rollups have also told me that they plan to head stage one very soon so rollups are rapidly becoming safer and rollups actually are finally affordable but this is not the only thing that's improved one of the other annoyances that I distinctly remember suffering on my trip to Argentina was uh I tried paying one of these people in eth on layer one the transaction fee was about $4 and the transaction took about 5 minutes to confirm now this was after EAP 1559 had come on chain but this particular wallet it had not actually upgraded to AP1 1559 yet so on bitcoin blocks come every 10 minutes and so you have to wait 10 minutes potentially an hour for transactions to confirm ethereum theoretically the block time is 13 seconds but because of the way that the gas market used to be really inefficient sometimes you'd have to wait a totally random amount if you get unlucky 5 minutes maybe even longer for a transaction to get included ep1 559 actually basically fixed this and if you add on the merge the one of the things that the merge did is it also cut in half the average waiting time until the next block and so with both of those those things actually these days I reliably have my own transactions confirmed in 5 to 15 seconds then if you use layer twos that have fast pre-confirmation often this gets down to 1 second and so basically the two big problems that are this the biggest things that made centralized ux much better than decentralized ux in 2021 today decentralized ux has them too but also we can look at the general us experience quality of applications so on the left here you have ether tweet from 2015 and you know it looked it clearly looks like a hackathon demo now on the right here you can look at Firefly which is a client for forecaster and Twitter and lens and if you look at the quality of the UI like this looks like a web 2 level of quality but it it's a decentralized application under the hood but also this year we saw progress in a account abstract we saw more and more people using safe we saw ZK email E 7702 we're starting to see mainstreaming in ZK sarks all kinds of different applications so we have new and better privacy protocols Railway Oxo uh zoo zoo pass which we'll talk about a bit later raro which can prove that in zero knowledge that you have a passport and then you could do voting on top of that also even existing ease of use improvements between ler 2s two years ago everyone was complaining about having to manually switch networks today I think like for a at least the last year I actually haven't yet manually had to switch networks so before the limitations of the technology were a stopping Factor like I even remember that moment where crypto kitties looked like it might become this really big breakout app but then what happened crypto Kitty own success pushed the ethereum gas price all the way up to 50 gay ethereum became basically unusable and that by itself put a ceiling on the grow this is nor true but this basically means that the reasons not to use crypto are nor here what about the reasons to come in the first place one of the uh mistakes that I think people sometimes make is uh talking about crypto as being an efficiency technology this is something that a lot of people talked about even back in 10 years ago so this is a random page from 2013 that was just listing the benefits of accepting Bitcoin right so P Made Easy um security and control over your money zero or L Fe or low fees protect your identity right so two of the four are I think things are feat that are features that are very unique to crypto the other two well they were unique to crypto then but are they now right today we have venmo we have a much better sea payments there's WeChat pay the centralized systems keep getting better and better but yet in some places payments and access to finance remain durably difficult why do they remain difficult it's not because of access to technology it's uh basically because of limit limitations in global politics so I think it's important to remember right that the kinds of benefits that crypto brings to the world they don't have to do with technological improvements of the same type as switching from a regular jet to a supersonic jet is a technological Improvement it's a type of Technology what kind of type so one way to look at this is uh this blog post that Josh Stark from the ethereum foundation wrote about two years ago and the title here is atoms institutions and blockchains and the thesis is that blockchains allow us to create a kind of digital hardness any kind of social hardness basically that lets us create persistent digital structures that are hard that and that can resist being broken in the same way that you can make hard physical structure out of something like concrete and if you think about how blockchains from some of the previous Cipher pug technologies that they came from things like mixnet things like tour things like bit torrent the thing that you realize is that blockchains are all about creating persistent structures that are extremely robust right so a file sharing Network well if a if your file share Network blows up that's fine you just switch to a different one and after a week everyone forgets if a blockchain blows up and you switch to a different one everyone loses all of their money this is a fundal difference between what technologies before blockchains did and what blockchains do and so blockchains because of this enable the internet to not just Route Around weaknesses in Old World structures but also do an actually better job of uh building better Alternatives that can solve similar kinds of problems so blockchains are digital concrete and digital concrete digital concrete for building digital Castles in the Sky so who here has uh seen this uh this movie a la Castle in the Sky raise your hand if you've seen it raise your hand if you know the opening theme song okay let's do a sing along so this is uh one of the actually so the reason why this movie is fun is I mean first of all I actually think it's like great and I think like studio gibl is absolutely top tier and you could probably tell I've seeing this like five times at least but um it turns out that it was like also somehow accidentally the inspiration for ethereum without us even me even realizing it basically what happened was in 2013 I was browsing a Wikipedia list of fictional elements right and I Came Upon ethereum in that list and in the list I saw okay this looks like a really nice name right and you know it reminds me of this 19th century scientific theory this idea that there's this medium that permeates everything and so okay fine I picked the name then two months later one of the ethereum foundation designers back before it was even called the ethereum foundation uh decided to use this diamond as the ethereum logo I thought okay this is a really cool diamond it's I like the logo it's beautiful years later I watched this movie for the first time and then I saw wait they have etherum crysteum cysts look diamonds and so it turns that a of eum like art was uh inspired by this without even realizing it so and the other thing about that like that song right is that the song like it actually sounds nice right like I think in crypto you know we actually need better songs right it's like you know a lot of the time if you ask someone to like come up with an Anthem for a project like they come up with something that's totally cringe right it's like decentralized We Stand United a hash confirmed a new block invited like okay you know if you like rap then that's good right but uh do you really want that to be your Anthem forever right okay so I mean you know back in 2013 right there was this other song that I remember there there it was uh there was this artist named krya it's Q said and done all your Fe inflate be on the Sun but no more because now there's a better one and its properties perform better than all the rest of them it's mathematical no more double spend it's encrypt put your cash in your brain or it's wearable a new form of wealth begins wait who here actually remembers that one okay I do uh so see it like digital Castles in the Sky I think are the unifying theme that combines the serious and the fun aspects of crypto together this is what I want people to remember a castle is something that can protect you and keep your family and keep your tribe safe a castle can also be a castle in Disneyland that lets your community have fun a castle can also be a museum that preserves all of the entire thousand year history of your culture and a digital Castle similarly can be all of these things and dig and digital castles of all types are something that we can build on on top of ethereum so done with digital castles um what should our key goal be so this is I know my view that I've said the whole time right we need to satisfy the needs of mainstream adoption and we need to hold on to open source and decentralization values at the same time what does this mean so example one W it's right there's two to hold your m one of those you Bally you know you do like the crazy self- sovereignty maximalist thing you write down a seed phrase you do everything offline you take your seed phrase you engrave it on a piece of titanium you put your titanium inside of a lock box that's made out of even more titanium and then you like put that lock box 10 me underground and then your coins are safe right so that's one approach the other approach is to say bro I'm like a normie I'm not going to do all that and so instead you basically go and you take your coins and you go off to give them to some trustworthy guy you know there's this nice guy his name is Sam he goes on panels with Bill Clinton he's got to be trustworthy and uh you know two years later it uh you know it turns out that your assessment of who's trustworthy and who's not was a little bit wrong so I think these are not the only two Alternatives right so basically if you want to be protected against centralized Bad actors then you do the traditional self- custody thing and if you really want you can put it in titanium and put it 10 met underground if you want to be protected from your own mistakes you do a centralized exchange what if you want both this is what smart wallets with multisig let you do multisig means you have multiple keys so you might have for example six keys out of which you need four to send a transaction and you could even have a rule that for small transactions you only need one and those keys can be any combination of keys that you can contrum friends and family ZK rappers of existing services so you could even make a yaik rapper of an email you can literally today make an ethereum account which is a smart contract wallet from which you can only send transactions if you generate a proof that you canoll a particular email address right so you can basically take web 2 uh trust anchors and you can like pull them into the web 3 world and in the web 3 world you can even diversify your trust right so you can ZK w a Gmail account which is a US company then you could combine that to make another one of your Guardians be a ZK rapper of uh you know like an Indian government ID and then you make a third key be a hardware wall wallet that was made by a company in China right like you can maximally diversify everything and so even you can actually get the benefits of institutional trust without a lot of the weaknesses so example 1.5 decentralized social media ux forecaster is a user experience wise warcast as a web2 quality app but you can set your recovery address the thing that has ultimate control over your account to be your multisig and I personally trust my multisig way more than any one of my centralized accounts example two payments so this is a doo it's a wallet that is meant to be entirely ethereum based but it has the same ux quality as venmo example three privacy pools privacy pools uses a mechanism where users can prove that their Depo their withdrawal came from some deposit without revealing which one but revealing that their deposit did not come from one of the bad guys and so this is a way that allows you to have a very high degree of privacy for regular users and meet a lot of uh important compliance needs but without actually having back doors example four ZK social media this is a zoo pole which uses zo pass and so can prove that you're a human prove that you're a member of a community solve proof of personhood problems solve reputation problems while still preserving your privacy it's not about either you're an Anon or no and nobody trusts you or you're KY didn't verify that you have no privacy it's like no you can have privacy and you can have trust at the same time example five ethereum layer one a lot of technological improvements that are happening that make the layer one both more performant in terms of red ring finality time increasing capacity and at the same time more decentralized and easy to verify and a lot of these things are already happening right so this like these are all directions that the ethereum ecosystem and I think crypto in general are going to be going over the next 10 years right we uh basically the two wrong paths are one is to sacrifice practicality for decentralization and forever being an ecosystem that's just appealing to itself and only has 691 users the other bad path is to sacrifice decentralization for practicality and to say okay well we're trying to get Mass adoption and so guess what the next great crypto application you have to log into it with a freaking Gmail account right what do we do best well no you know we do not have to take either of these dark choices we have decentralization and we have practicality at the same time eat both pills be purple take both thank you

    Thanks to the power of modern communication we have the ability to create technologies that are decentralized removing middlemen and allowing users to interact with each other directly through a global network decentralized applications have been becoming more and more important in the past 10 years and have the benefits of massively reducing costs and barriers to entry removing single points of failure preventing censorship and ensuring transparency and trust between all the parties involved in an interaction bittorrent a file sharing network that developed in the early 2000s is arguably the first decentralized application to have been created bitsword allows anyone to share any kind of file with anyone else in the world allowing people to distribute content quickly and easily even if they do not have the resources to pay for their own website or server five years later satoshi nakamoto came up with the idea of a blockchain a sort of distributed database and used it to build bitcoin the world's first decentralized currency decentralized currencies like bitcoin allow people to send money instantly anywhere around the world with no regard for national borders with negligible fees bitcoin is increasingly being used for international remittances micro payments and commerce online decentralized applications for finance cloud computing messaging and distributed governance are soon to come ethereum is a platform that is specifically designed for people to build these kinds of decentralized applications or dapps for short the ethereum client which we are calling the ether browser will include ability in peer-to-peer network for sending messages and a generalized blockchain with a built-in programming language allowing people to use the blockchain for any kind of decentralized application that they want to create ethereum can be used to build financial applications that are fully trustworthy and transparent because they run on the blockchain online cryptographically secure systems for managing your property and contracts social networking and messaging systems that allow users to maintain control of their own data systems for trading underutilized computational resources like CPU time and hard drive space and eventually tools for online voting and distributed governance and the most exciting applications of ethereum are probably the ones that we have not even thought of as with all new platforms for innovation like the protocols that underlie the internet itself it is not always easy to predict what they're going to be used for gmail facebook twitter instagram and the modern internet as a whole are all a result of early developments in the world wide web and javascript the programming language of the world wide web from the 1990s similarly by providing a universal programmable blockchain and packaging it up into a client that anyone can use the ethereum project hopes to do the same for finance peer-to-peer commerce distributed governance and human collaboration as a whole now the question is what will you build on top of ethereum.

    okay so back back when bitcoin was originally created in 2009 Satoshi zu was really testing two things at once so the first part is there's this idea of Bitcoin the decentralized currency it's a form of money that exists purely online and you could transfer it from anyone to anyone in the around the world instantly with pretty much no fees you can transfer money from Kyrgyzstan to Guatemala just as easily just as quickly and just as cheaply as you can to your own neighbor and there as we have seen there are a lot of people interested in that in that innovation Bitcoin form of money has attracted a pool of a ten billion dollars of wealth over the past five years it is being accepted by over 50 thousand merchants worldwide and there we have companies like Bitcoin coinbase that are injured that are trying very hard and I would say succeeding at getting Bitcoin adopted by increasingly large segments of the population and as a rymus said I think we're only getting started but at the same time there's also the other side of Bitcoin which is Bitcoin the blockchain so big Bitcoin the technology is this a global trust free peer decentralized database it's this database that anyone can add things to but no one could but you can't remove anything from and it just so own now it just so happens that currency is this is the first app now these two technologies by necessity have to be married together because in order to have the decentralized database you need to have security in order to have security you need to have incentives and you need to have a currency so so really Satoshi had to take these two concepts which are really quite different and test them both at the same time now this the second side of Bitcoin the Bitcoin blockchain is something that I think has been seeing a bit less attention maybe in the first few years but interest is also picking up so here are some of the first applications of Bitcoin not as a form of money but Bitcoin as a form of distributed consensus so first one is same coin name coin is essentially a distributed DNS system for those who do not know what a DNS system is when you go to google.com how does your computer know which server to talk to so the answer is that there exists this the system which Maps Google the name google.com to the server's IP address so your computer actually first queries this domain name system and it asks hey what server is google.com and the sir and the server answers and that's and that's how your you're able to talk to talk to Google server without having to memorize everyone's IP address second second part escort transactions so we a lot of people here I'm sure I've heard of the concept of multi set of multi-sig so the idea here is that you send money to say three people at once in such a way that you need two of those people to unlock the funds so what are some practical applications of that one practical application might be say consumer protection so for example if you want if I'm a merchant and I'm selling some product to you the consumer the simplest way to do that for it would be for you to just pay me and for me to send the product but what if you don't know me and I'm not necessarily trustworthy so then what you would do is we would both agree on an arbitrator and we would and you would send the money to our two of three multi-sig between yourself myself and the arbitrator I would send the product and then at some point normally you would confirm that you receive the product and the two of us together would release the funds now if one of us disappears or one of us turns out to be dishonest then the arbitrator can step can step in and work with the other person to recover the funds so this is essentially bitcoins also alternative to PayPal chargeback system now then we have this concept of colored coins colored coin the idea behind colored coins I would say saw its first beginnings in 2012 so the idea there is okay you have a blockchain and you have a currency on it but what if you can put other currencies on the blockchain as well so the idea there is this is to say I let's suppose that I am a goal sure I might be countable ammaji metals or some larger company and I and I wants to issue gold on the blockchain so what would I do I would take say ten bitcoins and I would and I would say each one of these bitcoins is also worth 10 ounces of gold and I would say it's each one and that's each one of these specific bitcoins and then you could actually track those specific bitcoins through the blockchain and you can treat them as sort of their own currency living and living inside the Bitcoin system and then if someone at some future point in time returns one of these colored gold coins to me then I will return to them in ten ounces of gold now then so now you have the system where you have lots of different currencies on the Bitcoin blockchain what's the next step well let's have a decentralized exchange between the currencies so as it turns out that this is this is actually somewhat hard to implement so it has to so the research behind it has actually taken some time to develop and we are actually seeing a lot of interesting protocols around that over the last six months now after that there's also some other interesting ideas there's this concept of smart property so the idea there might be what it what if you had or say a museum pass and in the idea there is that you would issue a currency was just where that currency has one unit and if you own that unit then you can use you can use your phone and you can and you can sign a message with the private with the private key that owns that that would old currency token and then that sort of works that works as a museum pass you can use it to get into a museum if you want to if you want to sell the museum pass then you just transfer the coin to someone else and now and now they can sign it with their phone they can get and they can gain access another idea is smart contracts so the idea there is that instead of having contracts that are in four that are enforced by the legal system you have contracts that in section we enforce themselves so one idea here might be a financial contract so suppose that I might want to put one a thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin into this financial contract and then someone some other counterparty would put $1,000 into the financial contract and then what one month later I would get $1,000 worth of Bitcoin back and the idea is what if you can have this contract in force itself so in that in that way I can essentially have a thousand dollars worth of value without without volatility risk on the on the blockchain without having to rely on it on any kind of centralized issuer finally there's this idea of decentralized autonomous organizations so the idea of a Dao or as other terms you might have heard include decentralized autonomous corporations or decentralized autonomous companies decentralized autonomous communities India there is to have either a company an organization perhaps could be a company it could be something like WikiLeaks it could be something like ICANN the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and numbers that sort of which is the organization that actually manages the game IP address allocation and DNS registration and so forth what if you could have these organizations live entirely on the cloud so these organizations would still control resources but those resources would be controlled by us by a smart contract that never expires it just keeps on updating itself so unformed so these are essentially some of the applications and there are thousands more than we haven't even thought of now here's just a some detail about how colored coins works so you would have some issuers acquires that that's some subset of bitcoins have have a certain color and then if you send if you send a transaction where the inputs have a certain color then the outputs have the same color now if the inputs have mixed colors then you might have some special rules applying and then you would just trace the transactions back through the Bitcoin blockchain to determine what color they are so you can see there a simple diagram is that you might have color you might have green coins blue coins and red coins perhaps representing US Dollars gold stocks in a company whatever else and you could simply trace them through the transaction graph and figure and figure out exactly who owns the coins of each color at any given time now another more advanced idea is this concept of a metal coin so the idea behind a metal coin is this is this idea that we should treat metic owns as view which would treat Bitcoin as this low-level protocol like a sort of tcp/ip on the internet and then we should build other protocols on top so this other protocol would use Bitcoin just as a data layer it would put data into the Bitcoin ran into Bitcoin transactions and then you could see there would be a completely separate matter coin protocol that would scan through the transaction to determine what the balances are so what are the advantages pretty theoretically pretty much no limits you could have decentralized exchange you could have savings accounts you could have advanced smart contracts you could have peer to peer Satoshi dice theoretically there's pretty much no limits to what can be done with this kind of paradigm however the problem problem is that there have been there are a lot of we a lot of people think that you can that you can just implement all this stuff on top of Bitcoin but in reality there are actually serious we serious scalability issues to doing so and as I'll explain these scalability issues are actually the reason why people have been so people have been so frustrated trying to implement this stuff a colored coins project has been worked working hard for the pet for the last 18 months and they've been trying to come up with extremely clever color transfer rules and to try and make things more efficient but so the fundamental issue here is this concept of simplified payment verification so in Bitcoin as it turns out you do not need to download the entire blockchain to have a secure of a coin client you can just look for specific transactions and now Bitcoin has this mechanism called a Merkel tree that you can use where you can prove that a certain transaction exists in the Bitcoin blockchain but only download a small part of the data you of the entire data set so the idea there is that you can't Act is that nobody can actually Forge any part of the Merkel tree because the different the differences sort of keep on cascading upwards and eventually there's some kind of inconsistency problem is however if you do if you try now with Bitcoin simplified payment verification is nice and easy lots of when clients use it it's great with colored coins it's actually hard because you have to trace every single transact every single transaction back all the way back through the back through the blockchain and I couldn't you have you might need to do hundreds or thousands of simple high payment verification requests with meta coins it's pretty much impossible every node has to process everything so here is where aetherium comes in so if your so what we've said with the theorem is that yes this idea that we should have HTTP on top of tcp/ip is wonderful that's the way the internet protocol works that's the way every other protocol works that's the way cryptocurrency protocols should work but bitcoin fundamentally was never designed to be a TC a tcp/ip bitcoin was more designs to be an SMTP smtp being the protocol for email it's a protocol that is that is very good at one particular test Bitcoin is very good is very good for transferring money but it was not designed as a foundational layer for other for any kind of protocols to be built on top so aetherium is there for its own blockchain so a theory borrows from ripple this concept that we should separate the state from the transaction list so you do not need to download every single every single transaction that ever happens in order to determine what the current state is and here is the fundamental part it has its own built-in programming language so the idea there is that if you look at a lot of the recent innovation in some of these so-called next-generation coins what someone's I've been saying is okay we want people want people to be able to do the centralized exchange on the blockchain here's a transaction stéphanie centralized exchange we want people to be able to do a peer-to-peer gambling there's a transaction type for that we want people to be able to have savings wallets or the transaction type for that we want people to be able to do escrow there's a transaction type for that so that is that is fundamentally if the wrong way to go about doing things just imagine if your computer actually had 30 Hardware modules you would it would have a hardware module for solitaire a hardware module for internet enter explore a hardware module for chrome hardware module for a for Photoshop that's what that's not the way we do things you know back in 1933 in the 1930s Alan - Alan Turing came up came up with this this concept of Turing complete programming languages where instead of having instead of specializing for each individual application you come up with a programming language and then that programming language is so powerful that you can build any application on top that can conceivably be built this is the reason why computers are so powerful today this is the reason why web browsers are so powerful today once we after we came out with JavaScript around around 2000 you know the internet just blew up the inventors of java scripts never intended for somebody to write gmail on top of javascript or for somebody to write facebook on top of JavaScript or for somebody to write Bitcoin wallets on top of JavaScript but javascript this programming language of the internet browser was a foundation for innovation and that's why 13 years later we are still innovating today and that's what I hope to bring to the world of cryptocurrency so what is a contract so aetherium instead of having lots of features tries to be simple it says if you really we do not have features we have just the programming language so everything that you want to implement through aetherium you would have to implement as a contract so a contract is like this automated agents that lives inside the blockchain and it has a certain amount of and it has some script scripting code built in and it can store it can store ether it can sting can store currents it can store currency units and you activate a contract by sending a transaction to it so the idea is that you can send money into contracts and you can send messages to messages to cut to contracts in order to make to make them carry out certain computations order or perhaps to authorize withdrawals or it's in order to make votes in a decentralized organization or even to make sure answers in an internal currency so out of this one built out of this one building block this is this one single leg of LEGO brick of cryptocurrency you can make pretty much anything soap etherium script is the language this is the current scripting language that we that we have is a language it's somewhat similar to Bitcoin script but it's also more powerful so we have a stack we have some operations we have but the differences with Bitcoin is that we have memory entries and also we have this concept of storage so BIC won't this is the other fundamental limitation of Bitcoin scripting language the kwid scripting language is binary a transaction is either spent or it's not spent that is fundamentally extremely limiting because you cannot have if you look at something like a decentralized organization or a financial contract of any kind of complexity you cannot reduce it to this concept of SS expires it's not expired so here we have contracts can have pretty much an unlimited number of number of states so you could have a contract to be at stage 1 at stage 2 at stage 3 you could have a contract store an entire write an entire balance sheet so right so now how about we'll talk about a few examples of what you can do with the theorem that perhaps might be difficult to do with Bitcoin first of all named coin so here is named coin in five lines of code so what is a so this named coin this is a 60 million dollar million dollar cryptocurrency you can implement the most basic version of name point in five lines of code so this is the contract so the idea here is that for is basically it's using contract storage so the contract look so a transaction it needs to have two data inputs the first data input is what name you want to register and the sec and the second one is what you want to register it with so that second one thing might be an address it might be some kind of might be a public key so then if some if it's already registered then you do nothing although other otherwise you register it and that's all it is so here's another interest the other interesting thing about aetherium is that we can work together with protocols that are not just financial so for example in there's the state there's this idea of bit message bit messages as purely peer-to-peer over open source decentralized replacement for email but one of the huge problems with big messages is usability aspect because in email you could send to some to some nice and easy email like Vitalik and etherial at aetherium zorg now here in a bit message there's no there are no email addresses there are these long 34 character bit message addresses nobody's going to remember a bit message address people don't even want to want to bid message addresses what if you could register a bit message address inside of this namecoin contract with something nice and simple like if it's allocated theorems org and then if somebody wants to send money to me there dear whoa it can just look up my they can enter vitalik at etherium org and their clients can just look up my actual bit message address inside of this namecoin contract create your own currency now creating now a lot of people are saying like we have way too many currencies now why do we have so why do we have so many currencies now I actually think this might this is extremely powerful in a way that not many people realize here's here's the deal in the in the past ten thousand years one of one of the major political dynamics has been this concept of centralization and decentralization we all understand the benefits of the central of decentralized system we all understand the idea the idea of localized markets of individuals acting independently but at the same but at the same time we understand that centralization has it has its benefits like there is and that one particular benefit there is this concept of public goods so there are a lot of things like science like scientific research like prevent like protecting the environment like fighting disease all these applications that are extremely valuable but they're but their value is so is extremely widely distributed so that each individual would only benefit an insect an insignificant amount from each from each particular action Mart pure markets have have no way of paying for this centralized and centralized institutions do simply because they are so large that they can act that they can absorb enough of the benefit for it to be worth it for them for them to do these things so this is why we have large corporations this is why we you this is why we often we have large governments and this is why we have large Don prophets now currencies are actually as a very interesting thing because creating your own current currency is actually Lee for the first time that we have something which is simultaneously decentralized and it can find these public goods you can have a currency such that twenty per say twenty percent of the issuance goes to P goes to people who do mathematical research and then if people want to support mathematical research they can accept the currency that's no caught that doesn't actually cost to them it's not like they're donating they're not losing money but at the same time the more merch the more merchants X the more people accept this currency the currency just naturally gained naturally gains value and people work people working on these on math problems just yet this this extra phantom value out of nowhere you could have currency is funded if that finds medical research you could have you could have currencies that are that try to find environmental applications so the idea here is that one let's not have one currency let's let's have thousands of currencies and we can have this form of this sort of economic democracy through a currency system so aetherium is a platform that makes that makes it a thousand times easier to bootstrap your own decentralized currency because you can just make it as a contract hedging contracts we talked about this a bit I put in one thousand dollars you put in one thousand dollars worth of worth of cryptocurrencies or worth of Bitcoin worth of ether and then a month later I get a thousand dollars back and you get the rest so what's the value proposition for you get this bet you get to speculate in favor of if they're added to X leverage and the value proposition for me is I get secured I get security I don't have to deal with volatility risk so this so we've seen for a lot of applications that are trying to say oh let's help if people want to have US dollars on the blockchain what's having let's have an issuer and that issuer will issue their own currency in that currency can be redeemed for US dollars yes that is one way of doing it but you have to trust an issuer so here's another way of doing it you would you would have a contract that listens to a bloomberg price feed of what the you what the value of ether in u.s. dollars is and then it automatically gives me back a constant value you know a constant value of ether aetherium is internal currency but a constant constant value measured in US dollars so here this is not trust free but this is massively reduced trust because instead of trusting an issuer all you have to trust as a price feed and you can trust like nine out of nine hundred eighteen price feeds if you wants you can do for voting forwards you can do proof of proof of stake voting there are lots of ways that you can mitigate any kind of problems here decentralized autonomous organizations so what if you could have a company who will whose organizational bylaws instead of being enforced in the legal system are enforced literally on the blockchain so the organization might have some capital it might have a millions all words were a million dollars worth of ether but then you would or might even have a million the organ is a this contract might even have a million a million dollars stuck in a in a in a hedging contract so this is the other nice thing about aetherium contracts can use contracts so the idea here is that you will need two-thirds of an organization's member members in order to agree to do anything and that's pretty much the only rule you could even have self-modifying code you could have a rule that says you need you need the support of two-thirds of an organization's members in order to change the rules of the organization sure and some right just know more and more here some other interesting applications savings wallets so we talked about multi signature escrow here are some the etherium potentially offers them massively expanded versions of multisig a score could you withdraw limits crop insurance what is crop insurance you could have a hedging khanjan you could have a financial contract off of the weather peer-to-peer gambling so you can do a peer-to-peer Satoshi dice on the blockchain decentralized exchange data storage decentralized Dropbox you can you can have a decentralized Dropbox implementation that lets anyone participate you will be able to earn money by renting out your hard drive mesh networking computation systems you can use big-big you can expand this idea of name point and turn it into an entire reputation system into a decentralized so into an entire decentralized social network and perhaps maybe even Skynet yes where will the okay so I'll repeat it okay so I'll talk a bit about the about the funding model so we will have a fundraiser for two months starting fabric starting February 1st it will be available at funds etherium org so will be so the idea is that part of the initial issuance will be one thousand for one Bitcoin or up to two thousand ether for one Bitcoin if you get in or way to compensate for the increased risk so the issuance model is that we will fund rate suppose that we hand out X ether through the fundraiser then then there will be about zero point about 0.5 X will be pre mind and then 0.4 X after that will be minds per year forever so it's this hybrid of master core of the master granion triple model and the pure bit the pure Bitcoin mining model and even to a slight extent the info the inflationary model so the answer is in terms of in terms of the portion of the pre mind that has already been allocated that is vested for one year so if any of the if any of the founders though we've leave the project then within the within one year then then or if and then the other founders have the right have the right during the first year to cancel the to cancel their allocation in which case that will simply be this redistributed handed back through the etherium organization as a long-term reserve and then did you on the site one of the second part right so right so the big so at the start the Bitcoin is going is going to be centrally managed we will have will have a transparent accounting system so the big one will go towards development it will go toward heavy security research go toward developing applications toward working with broad projects like bit message and store developing things like things like incubators so we will have models and we all release cell very detailed documents on how we're going to do that over the next few days and eventually we hope to turn the etherium organization itself into a Dao okay I um hold on yeah um I will I will be just uh standing over there outside so if anyone wants to ask questions feel free
