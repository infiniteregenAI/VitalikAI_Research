    A lot of the time when people talk about some of the challenges with crypto one of the answers that people tend to give is people tend to say you know this is still early days right we're still building we're still building out the basic infrastructure you know look how long something like the internet uh took to came into fruition right and this is something that I think people have been saying since uh like basically almost since Bitcoin itself launched and one of the challenges with saying this of course is that today you know we are not in early days anymore right Bitcoin has existed for 15 years ethereum as a project has existed for more than 10 years and uh you know we see things like Chad GPT rising up from not even existing as companies to suddenly completely changing everyone's understanding of what intelligence even is and so you have to ask the question of like well how do we actually even think about this right are we actually early and the way that I answer this question is I think we are not early to crypto but we are early to crypto actually being usable so let me explain what I mean with uh by going a little bit into history so who here remembers back in 2013 when we were all excited about Bitcoin and uh Bitcoin was the next big thing Bitcoin was the next big revolution for payments and people were making these really amazing and really Earnest efforts to try to just get regular Merchants all around the world to start accepting Bitcoin who here remembers room 77 in Berlin anyone here eight there yeah so the one on the right this is Boston it's a restaurant called thonus monkfish that's actually the first Bitcoin restaurant that I want to so back in 2013 you could be a proud Bitcoin accepted here restaurant and also be a proud LGBT Friendly restaurant at the same time and um you know crypto Twitter would not think that there is any contradiction uh so back at the time there was like real genuine excitement about this so what happened well one way to answer this is uh we can look a little bit further and uh the memory that comes to me is this to Argentina that I made in 2021 so this was my first time in Argentina and the first thing that I noticed was that there was this population Countrywide that was not just incredibly excited about crypto but that was actively using it on a massive scale like literally yeah I was walking around on Christmas Day and the first coffee shop that I noticed was open I walked in the owner knew who I was and the owner let me pay an e for the coffee and some dessert that I had with my friends now they were using crypto but they were not using decentralized technology what they what were they using it turns out the Argentinian locals were all using binance to binance transfers why binance to binance transfers are instant and binance to binance transfers are free and this is ultimately the same problem that I think ended up killing at least the original wave of exploration into getting everyone to adopt Bitcoin as a currency it was the fees if you remember the marketing at the very beginning why Bitcoin is great it talks a lot about how Western Union PayPal credit card companies they all just horribly you on fees they charge like incredibly High fees like they're awful right but then Bitcoin itself the fees went up to $50 um ethereum all the fees went up to the highest ever fee that I paid on uh ether was uh actually for a privacy preserving transaction so admittedly the gas went went up and uh you know basically like big parts of Twitter comment every time I do things so privacy protocols have a really good product Market fit and so the transaction feels about $800 so basically the reason why a lot of this stuff failed is fees what's new in 20124 well this is a chart of fees on ethereum lawyer 2s they have gone down from being somewhere between 10 and 50 cents to being under 1 cent basically zero at the same time optimism and arbitrum two major ethereum Lear ones have hit this important security Milestone that's called stage one and multiple rollups have also told me that they plan to head stage one very soon so rollups are rapidly becoming safer and rollups actually are finally affordable but this is not the only thing that's improved one of the other annoyances that I distinctly remember suffering on my trip to Argentina was uh I tried paying one of these people in eth on layer one the transaction fee was about $4 and the transaction took about 5 minutes to confirm now this was after EAP 1559 had come on chain but this particular wallet it had not actually upgraded to AP1 1559 yet so on bitcoin blocks come every 10 minutes and so you have to wait 10 minutes potentially an hour for transactions to confirm ethereum theoretically the block time is 13 seconds but because of the way that the gas market used to be really inefficient sometimes you'd have to wait a totally random amount if you get unlucky 5 minutes maybe even longer for a transaction to get included ep1 559 actually basically fixed this and if you add on the merge the one of the things that the merge did is it also cut in half the average waiting time until the next block and so with both of those those things actually these days I reliably have my own transactions confirmed in 5 to 15 seconds then if you use layer twos that have fast pre-confirmation often this gets down to 1 second and so basically the two big problems that are this the biggest things that made centralized ux much better than decentralized ux in 2021 today decentralized ux has them too but also we can look at the general us experience quality of applications so on the left here you have ether tweet from 2015 and you know it looked it clearly looks like a hackathon demo now on the right here you can look at Firefly which is a client for forecaster and Twitter and lens and if you look at the quality of the UI like this looks like a web 2 level of quality but it it's a decentralized application under the hood but also this year we saw progress in a account abstract we saw more and more people using safe we saw ZK email E 7702 we're starting to see mainstreaming in ZK sarks all kinds of different applications so we have new and better privacy protocols Railway Oxo uh zoo zoo pass which we'll talk about a bit later raro which can prove that in zero knowledge that you have a passport and then you could do voting on top of that also even existing ease of use improvements between ler 2s two years ago everyone was complaining about having to manually switch networks today I think like for a at least the last year I actually haven't yet manually had to switch networks so before the limitations of the technology were a stopping Factor like I even remember that moment where crypto kitties looked like it might become this really big breakout app but then what happened crypto Kitty own success pushed the ethereum gas price all the way up to 50 gay ethereum became basically unusable and that by itself put a ceiling on the grow this is nor true but this basically means that the reasons not to use crypto are nor here what about the reasons to come in the first place one of the uh mistakes that I think people sometimes make is uh talking about crypto as being an efficiency technology this is something that a lot of people talked about even back in 10 years ago so this is a random page from 2013 that was just listing the benefits of accepting Bitcoin right so P Made Easy um security and control over your money zero or L Fe or low fees protect your identity right so two of the four are I think things are feat that are features that are very unique to crypto the other two well they were unique to crypto then but are they now right today we have venmo we have a much better sea payments there's WeChat pay the centralized systems keep getting better and better but yet in some places payments and access to finance remain durably difficult why do they remain difficult it's not because of access to technology it's uh basically because of limit limitations in global politics so I think it's important to remember right that the kinds of benefits that crypto brings to the world they don't have to do with technological improvements of the same type as switching from a regular jet to a supersonic jet is a technological Improvement it's a type of Technology what kind of type so one way to look at this is uh this blog post that Josh Stark from the ethereum foundation wrote about two years ago and the title here is atoms institutions and blockchains and the thesis is that blockchains allow us to create a kind of digital hardness any kind of social hardness basically that lets us create persistent digital structures that are hard that and that can resist being broken in the same way that you can make hard physical structure out of something like concrete and if you think about how blockchains from some of the previous Cipher pug technologies that they came from things like mixnet things like tour things like bit torrent the thing that you realize is that blockchains are all about creating persistent structures that are extremely robust right so a file sharing Network well if a if your file share Network blows up that's fine you just switch to a different one and after a week everyone forgets if a blockchain blows up and you switch to a different one everyone loses all of their money this is a fundal difference between what technologies before blockchains did and what blockchains do and so blockchains because of this enable the internet to not just Route Around weaknesses in Old World structures but also do an actually better job of uh building better Alternatives that can solve similar kinds of problems so blockchains are digital concrete and digital concrete digital concrete for building digital Castles in the Sky so who here has uh seen this uh this movie a la Castle in the Sky raise your hand if you've seen it raise your hand if you know the opening theme song okay let's do a sing along so this is uh one of the actually so the reason why this movie is fun is I mean first of all I actually think it's like great and I think like studio gibl is absolutely top tier and you could probably tell I've seeing this like five times at least but um it turns out that it was like also somehow accidentally the inspiration for ethereum without us even me even realizing it basically what happened was in 2013 I was browsing a Wikipedia list of fictional elements right and I Came Upon ethereum in that list and in the list I saw okay this looks like a really nice name right and you know it reminds me of this 19th century scientific theory this idea that there's this medium that permeates everything and so okay fine I picked the name then two months later one of the ethereum foundation designers back before it was even called the ethereum foundation uh decided to use this diamond as the ethereum logo I thought okay this is a really cool diamond it's I like the logo it's beautiful years later I watched this movie for the first time and then I saw wait they have etherum crysteum cysts look diamonds and so it turns that a of eum like art was uh inspired by this without even realizing it so and the other thing about that like that song right is that the song like it actually sounds nice right like I think in crypto you know we actually need better songs right it's like you know a lot of the time if you ask someone to like come up with an Anthem for a project like they come up with something that's totally cringe right it's like decentralized We Stand United a hash confirmed a new block invited like okay you know if you like rap then that's good right but uh do you really want that to be your Anthem forever right okay so I mean you know back in 2013 right there was this other song that I remember there there it was uh there was this artist named krya it's Q said and done all your Fe inflate be on the Sun but no more because now there's a better one and its properties perform better than all the rest of them it's mathematical no more double spend it's encrypt put your cash in your brain or it's wearable a new form of wealth begins wait who here actually remembers that one okay I do uh so see it like digital Castles in the Sky I think are the unifying theme that combines the serious and the fun aspects of crypto together this is what I want people to remember a castle is something that can protect you and keep your family and keep your tribe safe a castle can also be a castle in Disneyland that lets your community have fun a castle can also be a museum that preserves all of the entire thousand year history of your culture and a digital Castle similarly can be all of these things and dig and digital castles of all types are something that we can build on on top of ethereum so done with digital castles um what should our key goal be so this is I know my view that I've said the whole time right we need to satisfy the needs of mainstream adoption and we need to hold on to open source and decentralization values at the same time what does this mean so example one W it's right there's two to hold your m one of those you Bally you know you do like the crazy self- sovereignty maximalist thing you write down a seed phrase you do everything offline you take your seed phrase you engrave it on a piece of titanium you put your titanium inside of a lock box that's made out of even more titanium and then you like put that lock box 10 me underground and then your coins are safe right so that's one approach the other approach is to say bro I'm like a normie I'm not going to do all that and so instead you basically go and you take your coins and you go off to give them to some trustworthy guy you know there's this nice guy his name is Sam he goes on panels with Bill Clinton he's got to be trustworthy and uh you know two years later it uh you know it turns out that your assessment of who's trustworthy and who's not was a little bit wrong so I think these are not the only two Alternatives right so basically if you want to be protected against centralized Bad actors then you do the traditional self- custody thing and if you really want you can put it in titanium and put it 10 met underground if you want to be protected from your own mistakes you do a centralized exchange what if you want both this is what smart wallets with multisig let you do multisig means you have multiple keys so you might have for example six keys out of which you need four to send a transaction and you could even have a rule that for small transactions you only need one and those keys can be any combination of keys that you can contrum friends and family ZK rappers of existing services so you could even make a yaik rapper of an email you can literally today make an ethereum account which is a smart contract wallet from which you can only send transactions if you generate a proof that you canoll a particular email address right so you can basically take web 2 uh trust anchors and you can like pull them into the web 3 world and in the web 3 world you can even diversify your trust right so you can ZK w a Gmail account which is a US company then you could combine that to make another one of your Guardians be a ZK rapper of uh you know like an Indian government ID and then you make a third key be a hardware wall wallet that was made by a company in China right like you can maximally diversify everything and so even you can actually get the benefits of institutional trust without a lot of the weaknesses so example 1.5 decentralized social media ux forecaster is a user experience wise warcast as a web2 quality app but you can set your recovery address the thing that has ultimate control over your account to be your multisig and I personally trust my multisig way more than any one of my centralized accounts example two payments so this is a doo it's a wallet that is meant to be entirely ethereum based but it has the same ux quality as venmo example three privacy pools privacy pools uses a mechanism where users can prove that their Depo their withdrawal came from some deposit without revealing which one but revealing that their deposit did not come from one of the bad guys and so this is a way that allows you to have a very high degree of privacy for regular users and meet a lot of uh important compliance needs but without actually having back doors example four ZK social media this is a zoo pole which uses zo pass and so can prove that you're a human prove that you're a member of a community solve proof of personhood problems solve reputation problems while still preserving your privacy it's not about either you're an Anon or no and nobody trusts you or you're KY didn't verify that you have no privacy it's like no you can have privacy and you can have trust at the same time example five ethereum layer one a lot of technological improvements that are happening that make the layer one both more performant in terms of red ring finality time increasing capacity and at the same time more decentralized and easy to verify and a lot of these things are already happening right so this like these are all directions that the ethereum ecosystem and I think crypto in general are going to be going over the next 10 years right we uh basically the two wrong paths are one is to sacrifice practicality for decentralization and forever being an ecosystem that's just appealing to itself and only has 691 users the other bad path is to sacrifice decentralization for practicality and to say okay well we're trying to get Mass adoption and so guess what the next great crypto application you have to log into it with a freaking Gmail account right what do we do best well no you know we do not have to take either of these dark choices we have decentralization and we have practicality at the same time eat both pills be purple take both thank you

    Thanks to the power of modern communication we have the ability to create technologies that are decentralized removing middlemen and allowing users to interact with each other directly through a global network decentralized applications have been becoming more and more important in the past 10 years and have the benefits of massively reducing costs and barriers to entry removing single points of failure preventing censorship and ensuring transparency and trust between all the parties involved in an interaction bittorrent a file sharing network that developed in the early 2000s is arguably the first decentralized application to have been created bitsword allows anyone to share any kind of file with anyone else in the world allowing people to distribute content quickly and easily even if they do not have the resources to pay for their own website or server five years later satoshi nakamoto came up with the idea of a blockchain a sort of distributed database and used it to build bitcoin the world's first decentralized currency decentralized currencies like bitcoin allow people to send money instantly anywhere around the world with no regard for national borders with negligible fees bitcoin is increasingly being used for international remittances micro payments and commerce online decentralized applications for finance cloud computing messaging and distributed governance are soon to come ethereum is a platform that is specifically designed for people to build these kinds of decentralized applications or dapps for short the ethereum client which we are calling the ether browser will include ability in peer-to-peer network for sending messages and a generalized blockchain with a built-in programming language allowing people to use the blockchain for any kind of decentralized application that they want to create ethereum can be used to build financial applications that are fully trustworthy and transparent because they run on the blockchain online cryptographically secure systems for managing your property and contracts social networking and messaging systems that allow users to maintain control of their own data systems for trading underutilized computational resources like CPU time and hard drive space and eventually tools for online voting and distributed governance and the most exciting applications of ethereum are probably the ones that we have not even thought of as with all new platforms for innovation like the protocols that underlie the internet itself it is not always easy to predict what they're going to be used for gmail facebook twitter instagram and the modern internet as a whole are all a result of early developments in the world wide web and javascript the programming language of the world wide web from the 1990s similarly by providing a universal programmable blockchain and packaging it up into a client that anyone can use the ethereum project hopes to do the same for finance peer-to-peer commerce distributed governance and human collaboration as a whole now the question is what will you build on top of ethereum.

    okay so back back when bitcoin was originally created in 2009 Satoshi zu was really testing two things at once so the first part is there's this idea of Bitcoin the decentralized currency it's a form of money that exists purely online and you could transfer it from anyone to anyone in the around the world instantly with pretty much no fees you can transfer money from Kyrgyzstan to Guatemala just as easily just as quickly and just as cheaply as you can to your own neighbor and there as we have seen there are a lot of people interested in that in that innovation Bitcoin form of money has attracted a pool of a ten billion dollars of wealth over the past five years it is being accepted by over 50 thousand merchants worldwide and there we have companies like Bitcoin coinbase that are injured that are trying very hard and I would say succeeding at getting Bitcoin adopted by increasingly large segments of the population and as a rymus said I think we're only getting started but at the same time there's also the other side of Bitcoin which is Bitcoin the blockchain so big Bitcoin the technology is this a global trust free peer decentralized database it's this database that anyone can add things to but no one could but you can't remove anything from and it just so own now it just so happens that currency is this is the first app now these two technologies by necessity have to be married together because in order to have the decentralized database you need to have security in order to have security you need to have incentives and you need to have a currency so so really Satoshi had to take these two concepts which are really quite different and test them both at the same time now this the second side of Bitcoin the Bitcoin blockchain is something that I think has been seeing a bit less attention maybe in the first few years but interest is also picking up so here are some of the first applications of Bitcoin not as a form of money but Bitcoin as a form of distributed consensus so first one is same coin name coin is essentially a distributed DNS system for those who do not know what a DNS system is when you go to google.com how does your computer know which server to talk to so the answer is that there exists this the system which Maps Google the name google.com to the server's IP address so your computer actually first queries this domain name system and it asks hey what server is google.com and the sir and the server answers and that's and that's how your you're able to talk to talk to Google server without having to memorize everyone's IP address second second part escort transactions so we a lot of people here I'm sure I've heard of the concept of multi set of multi-sig so the idea here is that you send money to say three people at once in such a way that you need two of those people to unlock the funds so what are some practical applications of that one practical application might be say consumer protection so for example if you want if I'm a merchant and I'm selling some product to you the consumer the simplest way to do that for it would be for you to just pay me and for me to send the product but what if you don't know me and I'm not necessarily trustworthy so then what you would do is we would both agree on an arbitrator and we would and you would send the money to our two of three multi-sig between yourself myself and the arbitrator I would send the product and then at some point normally you would confirm that you receive the product and the two of us together would release the funds now if one of us disappears or one of us turns out to be dishonest then the arbitrator can step can step in and work with the other person to recover the funds so this is essentially bitcoins also alternative to PayPal chargeback system now then we have this concept of colored coins colored coin the idea behind colored coins I would say saw its first beginnings in 2012 so the idea there is okay you have a blockchain and you have a currency on it but what if you can put other currencies on the blockchain as well so the idea there is this is to say I let's suppose that I am a goal sure I might be countable ammaji metals or some larger company and I and I wants to issue gold on the blockchain so what would I do I would take say ten bitcoins and I would and I would say each one of these bitcoins is also worth 10 ounces of gold and I would say it's each one and that's each one of these specific bitcoins and then you could actually track those specific bitcoins through the blockchain and you can treat them as sort of their own currency living and living inside the Bitcoin system and then if someone at some future point in time returns one of these colored gold coins to me then I will return to them in ten ounces of gold now then so now you have the system where you have lots of different currencies on the Bitcoin blockchain what's the next step well let's have a decentralized exchange between the currencies so as it turns out that this is this is actually somewhat hard to implement so it has to so the research behind it has actually taken some time to develop and we are actually seeing a lot of interesting protocols around that over the last six months now after that there's also some other interesting ideas there's this concept of smart property so the idea there might be what it what if you had or say a museum pass and in the idea there is that you would issue a currency was just where that currency has one unit and if you own that unit then you can use you can use your phone and you can and you can sign a message with the private with the private key that owns that that would old currency token and then that sort of works that works as a museum pass you can use it to get into a museum if you want to if you want to sell the museum pass then you just transfer the coin to someone else and now and now they can sign it with their phone they can get and they can gain access another idea is smart contracts so the idea there is that instead of having contracts that are in four that are enforced by the legal system you have contracts that in section we enforce themselves so one idea here might be a financial contract so suppose that I might want to put one a thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin into this financial contract and then someone some other counterparty would put $1,000 into the financial contract and then what one month later I would get $1,000 worth of Bitcoin back and the idea is what if you can have this contract in force itself so in that in that way I can essentially have a thousand dollars worth of value without without volatility risk on the on the blockchain without having to rely on it on any kind of centralized issuer finally there's this idea of decentralized autonomous organizations so the idea of a Dao or as other terms you might have heard include decentralized autonomous corporations or decentralized autonomous companies decentralized autonomous communities India there is to have either a company an organization perhaps could be a company it could be something like WikiLeaks it could be something like ICANN the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and numbers that sort of which is the organization that actually manages the game IP address allocation and DNS registration and so forth what if you could have these organizations live entirely on the cloud so these organizations would still control resources but those resources would be controlled by us by a smart contract that never expires it just keeps on updating itself so unformed so these are essentially some of the applications and there are thousands more than we haven't even thought of now here's just a some detail about how colored coins works so you would have some issuers acquires that that's some subset of bitcoins have have a certain color and then if you send if you send a transaction where the inputs have a certain color then the outputs have the same color now if the inputs have mixed colors then you might have some special rules applying and then you would just trace the transactions back through the Bitcoin blockchain to determine what color they are so you can see there a simple diagram is that you might have color you might have green coins blue coins and red coins perhaps representing US Dollars gold stocks in a company whatever else and you could simply trace them through the transaction graph and figure and figure out exactly who owns the coins of each color at any given time now another more advanced idea is this concept of a metal coin so the idea behind a metal coin is this is this idea that we should treat metic owns as view which would treat Bitcoin as this low-level protocol like a sort of tcp/ip on the internet and then we should build other protocols on top so this other protocol would use Bitcoin just as a data layer it would put data into the Bitcoin ran into Bitcoin transactions and then you could see there would be a completely separate matter coin protocol that would scan through the transaction to determine what the balances are so what are the advantages pretty theoretically pretty much no limits you could have decentralized exchange you could have savings accounts you could have advanced smart contracts you could have peer to peer Satoshi dice theoretically there's pretty much no limits to what can be done with this kind of paradigm however the problem problem is that there have been there are a lot of we a lot of people think that you can that you can just implement all this stuff on top of Bitcoin but in reality there are actually serious we serious scalability issues to doing so and as I'll explain these scalability issues are actually the reason why people have been so people have been so frustrated trying to implement this stuff a colored coins project has been worked working hard for the pet for the last 18 months and they've been trying to come up with extremely clever color transfer rules and to try and make things more efficient but so the fundamental issue here is this concept of simplified payment verification so in Bitcoin as it turns out you do not need to download the entire blockchain to have a secure of a coin client you can just look for specific transactions and now Bitcoin has this mechanism called a Merkel tree that you can use where you can prove that a certain transaction exists in the Bitcoin blockchain but only download a small part of the data you of the entire data set so the idea there is that you can't Act is that nobody can actually Forge any part of the Merkel tree because the different the differences sort of keep on cascading upwards and eventually there's some kind of inconsistency problem is however if you do if you try now with Bitcoin simplified payment verification is nice and easy lots of when clients use it it's great with colored coins it's actually hard because you have to trace every single transact every single transaction back all the way back through the back through the blockchain and I couldn't you have you might need to do hundreds or thousands of simple high payment verification requests with meta coins it's pretty much impossible every node has to process everything so here is where aetherium comes in so if your so what we've said with the theorem is that yes this idea that we should have HTTP on top of tcp/ip is wonderful that's the way the internet protocol works that's the way every other protocol works that's the way cryptocurrency protocols should work but bitcoin fundamentally was never designed to be a TC a tcp/ip bitcoin was more designs to be an SMTP smtp being the protocol for email it's a protocol that is that is very good at one particular test Bitcoin is very good is very good for transferring money but it was not designed as a foundational layer for other for any kind of protocols to be built on top so aetherium is there for its own blockchain so a theory borrows from ripple this concept that we should separate the state from the transaction list so you do not need to download every single every single transaction that ever happens in order to determine what the current state is and here is the fundamental part it has its own built-in programming language so the idea there is that if you look at a lot of the recent innovation in some of these so-called next-generation coins what someone's I've been saying is okay we want people want people to be able to do the centralized exchange on the blockchain here's a transaction stéphanie centralized exchange we want people to be able to do a peer-to-peer gambling there's a transaction type for that we want people to be able to have savings wallets or the transaction type for that we want people to be able to do escrow there's a transaction type for that so that is that is fundamentally if the wrong way to go about doing things just imagine if your computer actually had 30 Hardware modules you would it would have a hardware module for solitaire a hardware module for internet enter explore a hardware module for chrome hardware module for a for Photoshop that's what that's not the way we do things you know back in 1933 in the 1930s Alan - Alan Turing came up came up with this this concept of Turing complete programming languages where instead of having instead of specializing for each individual application you come up with a programming language and then that programming language is so powerful that you can build any application on top that can conceivably be built this is the reason why computers are so powerful today this is the reason why web browsers are so powerful today once we after we came out with JavaScript around around 2000 you know the internet just blew up the inventors of java scripts never intended for somebody to write gmail on top of javascript or for somebody to write facebook on top of JavaScript or for somebody to write Bitcoin wallets on top of JavaScript but javascript this programming language of the internet browser was a foundation for innovation and that's why 13 years later we are still innovating today and that's what I hope to bring to the world of cryptocurrency so what is a contract so aetherium instead of having lots of features tries to be simple it says if you really we do not have features we have just the programming language so everything that you want to implement through aetherium you would have to implement as a contract so a contract is like this automated agents that lives inside the blockchain and it has a certain amount of and it has some script scripting code built in and it can store it can store ether it can sting can store currents it can store currency units and you activate a contract by sending a transaction to it so the idea is that you can send money into contracts and you can send messages to messages to cut to contracts in order to make to make them carry out certain computations order or perhaps to authorize withdrawals or it's in order to make votes in a decentralized organization or even to make sure answers in an internal currency so out of this one built out of this one building block this is this one single leg of LEGO brick of cryptocurrency you can make pretty much anything soap etherium script is the language this is the current scripting language that we that we have is a language it's somewhat similar to Bitcoin script but it's also more powerful so we have a stack we have some operations we have but the differences with Bitcoin is that we have memory entries and also we have this concept of storage so BIC won't this is the other fundamental limitation of Bitcoin scripting language the kwid scripting language is binary a transaction is either spent or it's not spent that is fundamentally extremely limiting because you cannot have if you look at something like a decentralized organization or a financial contract of any kind of complexity you cannot reduce it to this concept of SS expires it's not expired so here we have contracts can have pretty much an unlimited number of number of states so you could have a contract to be at stage 1 at stage 2 at stage 3 you could have a contract store an entire write an entire balance sheet so right so now how about we'll talk about a few examples of what you can do with the theorem that perhaps might be difficult to do with Bitcoin first of all named coin so here is named coin in five lines of code so what is a so this named coin this is a 60 million dollar million dollar cryptocurrency you can implement the most basic version of name point in five lines of code so this is the contract so the idea here is that for is basically it's using contract storage so the contract look so a transaction it needs to have two data inputs the first data input is what name you want to register and the sec and the second one is what you want to register it with so that second one thing might be an address it might be some kind of might be a public key so then if some if it's already registered then you do nothing although other otherwise you register it and that's all it is so here's another interest the other interesting thing about aetherium is that we can work together with protocols that are not just financial so for example in there's the state there's this idea of bit message bit messages as purely peer-to-peer over open source decentralized replacement for email but one of the huge problems with big messages is usability aspect because in email you could send to some to some nice and easy email like Vitalik and etherial at aetherium zorg now here in a bit message there's no there are no email addresses there are these long 34 character bit message addresses nobody's going to remember a bit message address people don't even want to want to bid message addresses what if you could register a bit message address inside of this namecoin contract with something nice and simple like if it's allocated theorems org and then if somebody wants to send money to me there dear whoa it can just look up my they can enter vitalik at etherium org and their clients can just look up my actual bit message address inside of this namecoin contract create your own currency now creating now a lot of people are saying like we have way too many currencies now why do we have so why do we have so many currencies now I actually think this might this is extremely powerful in a way that not many people realize here's here's the deal in the in the past ten thousand years one of one of the major political dynamics has been this concept of centralization and decentralization we all understand the benefits of the central of decentralized system we all understand the idea the idea of localized markets of individuals acting independently but at the same but at the same time we understand that centralization has it has its benefits like there is and that one particular benefit there is this concept of public goods so there are a lot of things like science like scientific research like prevent like protecting the environment like fighting disease all these applications that are extremely valuable but they're but their value is so is extremely widely distributed so that each individual would only benefit an insect an insignificant amount from each from each particular action Mart pure markets have have no way of paying for this centralized and centralized institutions do simply because they are so large that they can act that they can absorb enough of the benefit for it to be worth it for them for them to do these things so this is why we have large corporations this is why we you this is why we often we have large governments and this is why we have large Don prophets now currencies are actually as a very interesting thing because creating your own current currency is actually Lee for the first time that we have something which is simultaneously decentralized and it can find these public goods you can have a currency such that twenty per say twenty percent of the issuance goes to P goes to people who do mathematical research and then if people want to support mathematical research they can accept the currency that's no caught that doesn't actually cost to them it's not like they're donating they're not losing money but at the same time the more merch the more merchants X the more people accept this currency the currency just naturally gained naturally gains value and people work people working on these on math problems just yet this this extra phantom value out of nowhere you could have currency is funded if that finds medical research you could have you could have currencies that are that try to find environmental applications so the idea here is that one let's not have one currency let's let's have thousands of currencies and we can have this form of this sort of economic democracy through a currency system so aetherium is a platform that makes that makes it a thousand times easier to bootstrap your own decentralized currency because you can just make it as a contract hedging contracts we talked about this a bit I put in one thousand dollars you put in one thousand dollars worth of worth of cryptocurrencies or worth of Bitcoin worth of ether and then a month later I get a thousand dollars back and you get the rest so what's the value proposition for you get this bet you get to speculate in favor of if they're added to X leverage and the value proposition for me is I get secured I get security I don't have to deal with volatility risk so this so we've seen for a lot of applications that are trying to say oh let's help if people want to have US dollars on the blockchain what's having let's have an issuer and that issuer will issue their own currency in that currency can be redeemed for US dollars yes that is one way of doing it but you have to trust an issuer so here's another way of doing it you would you would have a contract that listens to a bloomberg price feed of what the you what the value of ether in u.s. dollars is and then it automatically gives me back a constant value you know a constant value of ether aetherium is internal currency but a constant constant value measured in US dollars so here this is not trust free but this is massively reduced trust because instead of trusting an issuer all you have to trust as a price feed and you can trust like nine out of nine hundred eighteen price feeds if you wants you can do for voting forwards you can do proof of proof of stake voting there are lots of ways that you can mitigate any kind of problems here decentralized autonomous organizations so what if you could have a company who will whose organizational bylaws instead of being enforced in the legal system are enforced literally on the blockchain so the organization might have some capital it might have a millions all words were a million dollars worth of ether but then you would or might even have a million the organ is a this contract might even have a million a million dollars stuck in a in a in a hedging contract so this is the other nice thing about aetherium contracts can use contracts so the idea here is that you will need two-thirds of an organization's member members in order to agree to do anything and that's pretty much the only rule you could even have self-modifying code you could have a rule that says you need you need the support of two-thirds of an organization's members in order to change the rules of the organization sure and some right just know more and more here some other interesting applications savings wallets so we talked about multi signature escrow here are some the etherium potentially offers them massively expanded versions of multisig a score could you withdraw limits crop insurance what is crop insurance you could have a hedging khanjan you could have a financial contract off of the weather peer-to-peer gambling so you can do a peer-to-peer Satoshi dice on the blockchain decentralized exchange data storage decentralized Dropbox you can you can have a decentralized Dropbox implementation that lets anyone participate you will be able to earn money by renting out your hard drive mesh networking computation systems you can use big-big you can expand this idea of name point and turn it into an entire reputation system into a decentralized so into an entire decentralized social network and perhaps maybe even Skynet yes where will the okay so I'll repeat it okay so I'll talk a bit about the about the funding model so we will have a fundraiser for two months starting fabric starting February 1st it will be available at funds etherium org so will be so the idea is that part of the initial issuance will be one thousand for one Bitcoin or up to two thousand ether for one Bitcoin if you get in or way to compensate for the increased risk so the issuance model is that we will fund rate suppose that we hand out X ether through the fundraiser then then there will be about zero point about 0.5 X will be pre mind and then 0.4 X after that will be minds per year forever so it's this hybrid of master core of the master granion triple model and the pure bit the pure Bitcoin mining model and even to a slight extent the info the inflationary model so the answer is in terms of in terms of the portion of the pre mind that has already been allocated that is vested for one year so if any of the if any of the founders though we've leave the project then within the within one year then then or if and then the other founders have the right have the right during the first year to cancel the to cancel their allocation in which case that will simply be this redistributed handed back through the etherium organization as a long-term reserve and then did you on the site one of the second part right so right so the big so at the start the Bitcoin is going is going to be centrally managed we will have will have a transparent accounting system so the big one will go towards development it will go toward heavy security research go toward developing applications toward working with broad projects like bit message and store developing things like things like incubators so we will have models and we all release cell very detailed documents on how we're going to do that over the next few days and eventually we hope to turn the etherium organization itself into a Dao okay I um hold on yeah um I will I will be just uh standing over there outside so if anyone wants to ask questions feel free

  - Video: "Vitalik Buterin"
    hello. okay everyone's listening instantly that's good okay yeah so today i wanted to talk about something that's like different from what i talked about last year but still i'm you know within the range of things that i talk about um often which is just like some thoughts on the longer term future of where ethereum is uh going as a protocol right so here not just to the ecosystem but like you know specifically the blockchain and kind of the core infrastructure around the blockchain the consensus and just what do we expect that that side of things to look 10 years from now and how can we start now to build toward something that actually would be the an ethereum protocol that we actually that we would want to see in the long term um so the ethereum protocol right now is in the middle of this long and complicated transition and it's a transition toward becoming a system which is much more powerful and uh robust in a lot of ways right so at the end of the last year i published this kind of updated roadmap documents where i mean we talked about these kind of big five categories of like stuff that's happening in ethereum protocol lands right where there's the merge the surge the verge um and then a bit lower is going to be the purge and the splurge right so the merge is a proof of stake the surge is shorting um and the verge is verkle trees the purge is like things like state expiry and like deleting old history and the splurge is basically just all of the other fun stuff um so there's a lot to do in each of these categories right so like in the merge for example um you know we uh four choice improvements um actually i think uh this little square should be completely full now test networks uh this this one should be like probably 90 percent full because the only thing left to do is to do a merge on robston which should happen quite soon um and then you know merge and post merge obviously enabling withdrawals so that people who actually just started staking would would actually be able to get their money back but then there's also these like interesting longer term extras that we want to do right so uh single secret leader election basically means that like you make the who is going to be the proposer of the next block more unpredictable and the purpose of this is to like protect against uh dos attacks right so with um ssle you're not going to be able to tell who is going to create the next block until they actually release the block which is really amazing right because that basically it gives us really nice security property where like if you're an attacker and you want to stop blocks from being created you don't know who you have to attack um single swat finality um it used to be called single squad confirmations now we're just calling it single swat finality uh basically moving to a world where ethereum can actually confirm blocks within a single slot uh this is something that i have been kind of looking into and talking about for probably the last like half a year or so there's a lot more work on it happening uh one of our researchers uh francesco has also uh done a lot of work and there's a lot of uh interesting stuff being done by consent as researchers on trying to figure out the best way to do this but it's like actually more possible than it seems which is uh interesting and then better signature aggregation that's actually kind of part of facing us what finality right so there's a lot of stuff to do and proof of stake the end state of all this will be a proof-of-stake mechanism which is really great but in order to get there there's like all of this so work that needs to be done uh the surge sharding right so this is um basically yeah i think uh before we wanted to do four four eight eight uh we decided that we would like to rearrange the numbers a bit so instead we're doing four eight four four um which is uh proto-dink charting uh basically trying to kind of lay the groundwork for doing full sharding kind of have all of the data formats in place um and also at the same time adding like at least a little bit more data space that rollups can use to make rollups much cheaper right potentially some you know could even be something like 10 times cheaper uh so that would that's like the prototyping charting then after that we want to do ding sharding and which adds a data availability sampling um and then we want to do like other things uh around just increa increasing the amount of space that we have some kind of like fast uh faster confirmation so that ethereum could have not not just greater scalability but also like lower latency and at least until you get some degree of confirmation that your transaction got included so just a lot of like interesting things at the end of which ethereum will be a far more scalable system ethereum today can process about 15 to 20 transactions a second and this ethereum including the roll-ups including the sharding um if at least according to the math it's able to going to be able to process 100 000 transactions a second um and you know hopefully there's going to be a lot a lot of other benefits that come at the same time right the verge uh stateless clients so you will be able to verify ethereum blocks and even be a validator without having hundreds of gigabytes on your disk uh which is so great for decentralization the purge uh so trying to actually cut down the amount of space you have to have on your hard drive trying to simplify the ethereum protocol over time and not requiring nodes to store history and then just like this big long list of things right so there's this big long list of like really fun stuff that will make ethereum into a much more powerful system a much more robust system a much more secure system and even a more decentralized system but it's a long and complicated transition there's a lot of stuff that's happening like each one of these boxes uh basically like all has like some kind of team associated with it at this point uh so no a lot of work that needs to be done right um so the difference between bitcoin and ethereum is uh that uh bitcoiners consider bitcoin to be eighty percent complete and it's here but ethereums consider ethereum to be 40 complete right this is like i think actually something that i've said a couple of times before and you know when you look at what ethereum is trying to accomplish and you know it's true right like the ethereum protocol is like really trying to still trying to fulfill this role of being some kind of secure base lawyer but trying to do so in such a way that like it actually has the functionality that it needs to be to be a secure a secure base lawyer for the stuff that people actually wants to do right and that does involve adding more features it does involve doing more work um and uh but you know at this um at the same time kind of there you know there is also still this kind of this end goal but you know we're a bit further away from getting there um i'd say it's 50 ethereum it can go up to being 55 percent complete after the merge uh so uh we're getting close um you know we i think we're getting close to kind of the second half of um this uh kind of big long vision right which is uh really amazing and like you know all of the people that have been uh working hard to make it happen should be super happy at this point um so completing the transition involves deep changes right it involves deep changes and i don't just mean like deep changes that people who write code have to care about i mean deep changes in how people think about the ethereum protocol and kind of conceive of the properties that the ethereum protocol provides people who interact with ethereum uh so monetary policy right so the switch from proof of work to proof of stake is gonna decrease issuance from five million a year to this kind of weird math equation that's like 166 multiplied by the square root of the total deposits so if there's a million if staking it's 166 000 if there's a hundred million he's taking it only goes up to 1.66 million so in all cases it decreases by a lot right it's not fixed anymore but it's much lower than it used to be so monetary policy is changing security model is uh changing so proof of stake is it is much more secure than proof of work but it does have its trade-offs and this concept of weak subjectivity is one of the big tradeoffs of proof of stake and you know this is something that i've talked about a lot this is something that we've talked about a lot this is something that ethereum researchers have already built a lot of tools around measuring but it is a change to the security model data availability sampling so this is the idea that you can literally have a blockchain run without needing even a single node to process the entire chain which is something that like from a blockchain point of view is very fascinating and mind-blowing but from a kind of broader distributed systems point of view it's like totally uh common sense right like nobody would even consider building a version of bittorrent where everyone has to download every movie right but that's how blockchains work today uh so trying to kind of combine the actual distribution uh like of that you see in peer-to-peer networks where you actually have like different parts of the network responsible for different parts of the data with the uh security properties and blockchains provide right like this is basically what um ethereum is trying to go towards and that does include some change some changes to the security model layer 2 history access so a lot of dapps that are built on ethereum historically they've relied on this assumption that you can use things like history access that and you can look at historical logs you can look at historical transactions and the dap from like you directly using the web3 protocol would be able to just like tell you the entire history of everything related to you that happened in the dab right and this is something that has been true for ethereum's history but it's something that's not going to be true anymore and the reason why it's not going to be true anymore is because of eip4444 right basically with the ip444 moving moving toward a world where this function of accessing and restoring and retrieving all of the entire history of ethereum is not going to be a kind of core requirement of an ethereum node anymore right and the reason why it has to be done is basically because people value scalability and if we want scalability um and if you want decentralization so like the ability to run nodes easily then you just can't require nodes to store this kind of constant ever-growing amount of space now there are alternatives right so there are plenty of like very secure very decentralized ways to store the history that do not involve requiring every single ethereum node to store the history um so there's like second layer protocols things like the graph there's work that's being done by people in the portal network there's a work that's being done by some other groups there's people trying to kind of upload a part ethereum history it's a bit torrent there's block explorers of which there's like a bunch and you can probably make a multiplexer that just like keeps on asking each one of them and you can even make a protocol that like asks them for proofs to make it more secure um so there's lots of alternative ways to access history but that's not going to be like something that the ethereum protocol itself is directly responsible for right so that's a change to also a change to the security model now it is a change that i think dapps have already mostly adapted to like if you use dapps today most in the access history most of them don't you are not going to use like the web 3 api directly lots of them already use the graph right so this is something that i think the ecosystem is already adapted to but it is a change that is a kind of unnecessary part of ethereum becoming more decentralized and more scalable um new cryptography so the ethereum of 2015 relied only on ketchup hashes and elliptic curve cryptography for security right just those two ingredients the ethereum of uh 2023 is going to rely on that plus more complex uses of elliptic curves with things like uh with things like vertical trees if they come in 2023 it could be 2024 as well um also elliptic curve pairings which is a more complicated form below the curve math which the beacon chain already relies on um some like universal trusted set up for data availability sampling um and you know potentially like some eventually the randomness is going to be augmented by vdf as well right so there's also like some new cryptographic assumptions that are being introduced and these new cryptographic assumptions give us a lot of really massive benefits right so like the ethereum of today that uses bls signatures that rely on pairings that allows us to have hundreds of thousands of validators which allows us to have a led people stake if they directly with a minimum of 32 if does anyone remember what that minimum was before we decided to use bls it was 1500 right so we added a security assumption and or on a new cryptography and the benefit is that staking became 50 times more accessible so basically there are very real benefits that are going on but also the real changes here um the transaction inclusion process so eip 1559 happened last year it was amazing it changed a lot but it also changed a lot about how we have to think about including transactions account abstraction uh basically people being able to send transactions that are verified not just by elliptic curve signatures but by like whatever kind of algorithm they want so like so you could have better multisigs better smart contract wallets better social recovery wallets move to other algorithms um potentially um with account abstraction you could also have signatures that are much smaller you can use a signature aggregation and this is really powerful in roll-ups because uh so here the erc4337 team this is the team that's uh working with the working on the account abstraction of eoc right now they've been starting to do this and with a signature aggregation you'll basically be able to remove the 65 bytes from every transaction that are the signature and replace it with just 65 bytes for an entire block right um so potentially roll ups could be could become three times cheaper if this is all implemented right so a lot of like inch b uh proposer builder separation could also change how transaction inclusion works right so there's a lot of things that are happening and a lot of things that have big and important benefits but that also require kind of changing how we think about certain things right and it's also involved building a much stronger and a much more capable research and development ecosystem that's capable of coming up with these changes testing them making sure that they're that they actually do what they need to do implementing them implementing them across five clients making sure they're implemented the same way across five clients making sure there's no bugs and doing that entire pipeline and actually getting them to production right so there's a lot of stuff happening but and um this is where it gets to kind of the more cautionary part of the talk that doesn't mean that we should keep going this way forever okay so basically i think um so this is this is i think both my preference and also my impression of something that a lot of people want for the ethereum protocol which is basically for the a desire that for ethereum to kind of eventually settle down right so right now i think we're entering into this kind of period of rapid change where the capabilities of ethereum are increasing rapidly right so you know we got eip 1559 we're going to get a switch to proof of stake we're going to get vertical trees we're going to get single secret leader election um and we're going to get evm improvements and all of that all of this are really cool stuff but at some point the rate of change of the aer protocol is going to have to again slow down right and uh like basically it does it doesn't necessarily mean that that kind of ethereum ossifies completely but it does mean that it does kind of look somewhat like more like a system that optimizes for safety and predictability and less like an ecosystem that optimizes for impressing and dazzling people so why settle down um by the way these are um qr code links to kind of articles where i talk about some of these things in more detail but uh one reason is the layer separation vision right so this philosophy that layer one is for security and dependability layer two is for rapid iteration action high scalability extremely fast response times like good features for users and all of these different things right and the theory is that we can get the basically the benefits of both at the same time and the way that we do that is we have this underlying safe and secure l1 that focuses on safety and security and that focuses a kind of uh on not on a kind of out maneuvering ever kind of everyone else and not on kind of doing everything else as quickly as possible but on surviving and um you know on surviving much much longer than like things like things like luna do right um so the layer one you know really needs to optimize for being safe and layer two can optimize for like actually doing really amazing and impressive stuff um and all your two has been doing amazing and impressive stuff right like there have been all of these azik evm announcements that we saw over the last couple of days um there's a lot of work that's being done um you know by yeah both the optimistic and the zk teams like um optimism has um added uh compression um arbitrary has been kind of quietly yeah uh progressing and just uh you know becoming more stable and adding features um you know starknet has been recently made their role their uh kind of announcements um and uh we we're starting to see more and more i don't know what kind of a network starting is going to shape up into being and there was just a lot of amazing work that was done on cairo there minor zika sync um is going forward and uh you know polygon zika roll up uh so you know scroll this kind of big long list of of uh teams uh that has been just doing all this amazing work um and [Music] that like really has been kind of rapidly iterating and um acting um so the reason i think behind this idea is the functionality escape velocity thesis right so the functionality escape velocity thesis that basically says once l1 is strong enough the rest can be done by the way too right so this kind of vision of simple boring slow l1 but and like fast action l2 is a good vision but it requires l1 to be good enough to actually support it right it's kind of simple similar to what's our incompleteness where if you have a computer that's powerful enough then it's powerful enough that you can build basically anything on it but if the computer isn't powerful enough then like very quickly it turns into a machine that can do almost nothing right like in terms of what you theoretically can do on a computer from 2020 and say 1990 the difference isn't too large right it's just a difference of like what's the level of like scale that you can um and the level of performance that you can achieve but if you look at the difference between an early computer and say a pocket calculator well the difference is fundamental right it's like no matter how many billions of years you have with a pocket calculator you can't make it run minecraft with a you know computer from 1990 you can right and basically the functionality escape velocity thesis says that there's something very similar like this for blockchains where blockchains have to provide this basic set of ingredients uh so enough data for roll-ups rich statelessness so you can do a kind of logic around logic around like things like either snarks or fraud proofs um just some kind of basic censorship resistance functionality i'm just having an asset like this kind of fairly basic list of things um that ethereum already provides a lot of but it doesn't quite yet provide 100 of and that big long list of features that we're looking at adding in is in some ways about kind of filling that in right and also developers need a break new features need time to de-risk and i'm like basically again you know once you start working less hard on kind of making features go up you can actually start working harder on doing other things that are very meaningful in other ways so one of the trade-offs in doing this well is uh there's this trade-off that ethereum has of uh complexity of the change that's being made versus the complexity of the final result right and this is one of these kind of very subtle points where basically there are a lot of opportunities that are kind of short-term pain and long-term gain so what do i mean by this um banning self-destruct right so this is uh one of the kind of things that i've been pushing for a long time it's one thing that i think a lot of the core developers have been pushing for a long time basically the self-destruct top code is just one not actually that useful and two it's uniquely bad in terms of like how much complexity it adds to the evm and two implementations of the evm and to the difficulty of making other kinds of changes to ethereum and so if we just remove that opcode that's actually a very significant uh gain in simplicity but it it does come at the cost of breaking backwards compatibility for a few a very small number of applications um reforming how gas costs gas costs work around child calls around memory just like the way that gas works today is in some ways needlessly clunky in a lot of cases it's both too complicated and too kind of overfitting to uh very specific situations um eap4444 so this is requiring no longer requiring ethereum clients to store the entire history evm improvements so the evm object format eip is that try to like allow you to add other sections to an evm code a switch to vertical trees and a and what comes with a switch to vertical trees is some other changes to how gas rules work right so there's a a lot of these opportunities that add functionality and that even increase the simplicity of ethereum right so ethereum after you go through with all of this actually becomes a system where like the number of lines of code you need to have in a client and even in the spec actually decreases over time right which is amazing but in order to actually have all of these benefits like you know you have to go through a short-term pain now what do we mean by short-term pain one is that the features have to be implemented right another thing that i mean is that there are a couple of like applications that are designed in just like ways that are uniquely unfriendly to some of these changes and those applications will just have to change how they work right now this is of course something that should only be done with a kind of very long lead time right so to make sure that everyone who's going to be affected by it is aware of it everyone who is uh has an application that like really depends on exactly how things work now has the opportunity to change to something else but once it's done and this is an opportunity to do something where there is this kind of pain that happens once but then there basically future generations will be very thankful that uh you know there aren't these kind of annoyances that have that people have to keep on coding around and think and uh thinking about forever um so the ideal long-term goal here is basically that kind of the total complexity of ethereum so not the same thing as the level of capability right so the level of capability goes up but the level of complexity like we're here we're still adding complexity but i have this hope that the level of complexity at some point can even start to go down right now why can it why would it go down because of some of these simplifications also because ethereum clients would not necessarily have to keep on supporting very old versions of the ethereum protocol um after the merge you could even build an ethereum client that just completely does not know that the proof of work phase ever happened which is like a huge uh simplifying factor in a lot of ways right so there's um a lot of ways in which complexity of the system can go down over time um so in the short term some of this does mean breaking backwards compatibility in a few very very limited cases right it's like really a very small number of cases and like like one of my claims here is that like that is okay right that is like basically yeah you do need like at some point an ecosystem does have to be willing to do this kind of short-term pain and long-term gain gain trade-offs but an ecosystem also should not be in this kind of mode of like changing things rapidly forever right so short term still in rapid change mode but longer term at some point you do need to kind of have this pivot to a in an ecosystem where change is less rapid even more consensus on everything is required than today things do keep moving even slowly and that does look very different from the from the way that ethereum works now uh so things in particular that like i would be scared of doing right so things that i think we should not do one is uh adding support for multiple vms so simultaneously support evm and ewasm and cairo and other stuff the reason why you don't want to do that is because that just multiplies consensus complexity like getting rid of the evm is too hard and so if we add stuff well we're going to have like three different vms and the number of lines of code in the protocol is just going to you know keep on blowing up forever right um getting comfortable with base layer snarks before we have much better circuit legibility right so before we really have the tools to kind of dig into zika snark circuits and like be able to properly understand like here's exactly what's going on at you know each individual constraint right so basically like my opinion right now is that starks are still a bit a bit too black boxy and um you know hopefully they're going to become less and less black boxy over time which is something that's uh that would be really amazing uh but i like i personally do think that something like that is a prerequisite right we want to make snarks more understandable before we make the ethereum base layer itself actually depend on them um also i'm like i personally am scared of surrendering to this idea that like it's okay if no single person can understand the ethereum protocol because we can specialize like i think part of ethereum being a trustless protocol should actually be ethereum being a simple enough protocol that if you really wanted to wrap your head around the entire thing you should be able to right and like that is in in some ways very kind of constraining and that does be imply a layer one that uh you know has less kind of dazzling bells and whistles and less functionality in a lot of ways but in my opinion i think if the goal is to create a layer one that's kind of maximally robust and maximally dependable this is something that i'm gonna like i would say is worth it so what are other like awesome things that you could that i think that we should actually increase our focus on over time right so these are things that i think we need to start working on today and we have started working on today but things that we're like basically once the level of effort involved in increasing capability starts decreasing the level of effort involved in making all this other stuff happen can start actually going up right so one of them is like an easy to use light client for the ethereum consensus layer and the execution layer and layer twos and for such a thing to be a default right so like basically i want to see a world where instead of the default like instead of a a new ethereum user by default using metamask that plugs into infira i want them to you or would like to see a world where they can use some wallet that actually is a light client that directly uses decentralized protocols to plug straight into the the ethereum network right and for that to happen both for base ethereum and for layer twos so also for um you know starch net and optimism and decay sync and arbitrary and scroll and all of these and polygons as well to um also kind of somehow plug into the system and so you can actually directly have light clients that can act they can access and directly verify all these systems better support for homestakers and better support for like smaller scale decentralized taking polls right so even for people who need uh staking like um staking pools because they don't have 32 ether they don't have like whatever the level of ethos that's going to be required still better give them better ability to like join a smaller scale pool that doesn't involve joining one of the big ones also the ability to run a full node on lighter hardware i think this is something that especially once we have more zk snarks can easily improve over time right like so once we have stateless clients with vertical trees it'll improve a lot because you're not going to need like 500 gigabytes of hard disk space anymore right like post vertical trees it should be possible with a well-designed client to just run everything entirely in ram right like it should not actually require that many that many gigabytes now potentially being a validator might require storing other stuff and it might kind of go up a little bit beyond that but hopefully not too much um you know like i personally still want like mobile phones taking to be eventually possible um so like basically how far can we go on like making the entire ethereum ecosystem like actually meaningfully decentralized meaningfully reduce dependencies on kind of like single actors meaningfully reduce privacy risks that come from dependence on single actors um and just actually make the the ethereum network kind of resilient in the way that i think a lot of people want it to be uh so pursuing decentralization goals is harder today because the protocol changes quickly because the total complexity is getting higher but in a protocol that is simpler and a protocol that is slower changing i think pursuing more decentralization is actually something that does become easier so i do think that there are changes that are worth making in the long term right so like i personally am not predicting that the ethereum network is going to act like ever be like become something that undergoes literally zero change um and like there are here's some examples that are i think are actually worth it um upgrades from quantum resistance quantum computers there's a big chance that they're eventually going to come and once quantum computers come we have to upgrade to different cryptography right so can't use elliptic curves can't use pairings can use hashes can you starks can you use lattices right uh can he use either genius so that um basically once quantum computers come we are going to have to kind of get used to using different tools which is uh obviously something that the ecosystem will have to learn its way around it is something that involves some sacrifices but it's something that just has to be done if you want ethereum to be secure um if zkvms work well increasing transaction space in the base lawyer so if once you know we have good circuit legibility and we have a very good zka implementations that can snark verify the evm then that's something that could be applied in the base layer you could start adding more transaction space you can start using more data space to or more of this data availability space to add transaction space um so things could be done there um if much better cryptography comes out that lets us massively improve efficiency and simplicity we should use it right so today i'm advocating and a lot of people have been advocating for ethereum to switch from hex merkle patricia trees to vertical trees maybe in the future um ha like just hashes and arithmetically friendly hashes are going to be de-risked enough and are going to be friendly enough that we're going to want to actually give up on vocal trees and do stark proofs of uh arithmetic friendly merkel trees instead if that happens then like i think we should do it um and also i think we should keep an open mind right and like we don't know what the needs of 2032 are going in demand um so one example of this is like the whole mev uh situation right like in the kind of the centrality of mev as this issue that the ethereum protocol needs to like really build and work around that's something that we weren't really aware of back in 2019 and we became aware of in 2021 and now it's like well understood and it's part of like how we think about the ethereum protocol in 2022 right so there could be other things like that in the future like you know we might have to think in some different way about you know how to deal with 51 attack so you might have to think about like adding other kinds of of features to ensure a staking decentralization right like there are more things that could happen there are always unknown unknowns um but at the same time like that number of unknown unknowns is something that i do think should uh decrease over time right uh so basically the challenge here is uh you know how do we balance all of these different demands like i think in the short term we are in this kind of environment where it's just unavoidable that all of these rapid changes that are going to produce all of these really important things that ethereum people have been looking forward to for a long time are going to have to be done right like people have been looking forward to proof of stake for a long time who here wants to cancel proof of stake i saw one person tried to raise their hand and then lower it for fear of getting cancelled um no no please if you want to cancel if you want to cancel proof of stake we're not going to cancel you or just uh you know there there are plenty of blockchains like there is uh ethereum classic which is you know the original ethereum which did not betray the vision by forking the dow it's a very welcoming community and i yeah you know i think they'll definitely welcome proof of work fans um so it's not even a joke like if you like proof of work you should go use ethereum classic it's a totally fine chain um but but anyway um so you know proof of stake lots of like it's a big change but lots of benefits um sharding right so anyone here want to cancel sharding okay now let's see not too many okay i see a couple of hands that raised a little bit more confidently right but i think like you know in general like i do think that charting is popular because people do realize that like in order to fulfill the ethereum vision we want we actually want to have a much lower transaction fees and we actually want to be able to support you know 50 000 transactions a second somehow and um you know if it's not done in a way that's decentralized it's going to be done in a way that's centralized right so shorting's important right so there is this but there is this balance right of like what needs to be done and um you know what kinds of things can we just leave to layer two and so in the short term um you know there's all of this kind of stuff that i do think needs to be done but in the longer term there is also this challenge of like shifting down the gears again and like actually yeah also settling into this new this and you are normal of ethereum actually being this kind of dependable system that at some point is only going to change very infrequently um and you know that's uh going to be a transition i expect it's you know going to happen at some point but you know what that's going to look like we'll see um and i think it's this is also something that that i know all of the different parts of the ethereum community really need to kind of pay attention to and you know it's uh kind of can like being part of kind of figuring out what this longer term ethereum will look like that's uh something it's not even just for core developers um it's also like there's lots of things that people just anywhere out there in the ecosystem can do to contribute to this there's lots of things that just people out there in the community even people out there in the application layer can do to kind of contribute to this right uh so um you know make sure that uh your application continues to work and even works better um in a world where the ethereum protocol is uh kind of upgraded in a bunch of ways um and uh at the same time um you know also the layer two teams right like if layer one is going to slow down its rate of change at some point then like uh to the extent the change is still required the layer two protocols are going to have to pick up the mantle and you know i think our layer two ecosystem is great and that's going to keep becoming even greater so thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes hello um apparently there's questions so to quiet everyone down the rest of my private key is eight four f uh c two six one nine okay questions go ahead okay i'm very interested in life yours also bound tokens and this is a very fascinating ideas and we i mean the blockchain-based system are public so if we want to make it so a private show i read your paper in my hand now so i mean the decentralized id may be of the best solutions or do you have any uh perspective regarding decentralized id to help build the implementations of private so thank you yeah i mean i think my general view on that topic is like i don't think that i think now is way too early to be debating between like specific packages of solutions right i think like there's a lot of people that have this mindset that like soul bound tokens represents like a particular category of like ways of doing things and decentralized identity represents like a particular category of ways of doing things and i think it's just like way too early to like have that kind of thought because i think we're still in the process of figuring out like exactly when do we need negative reputation um exactly what kinds of attestations do we need like you know what how does it gonna interact with community recovery and like this big long list of things right uh so i think uh like my personal view is that we should have an open mind we should design our identity and like reputation systems around actual applications so like i do not trust anything that would come out if i came out of a committee of web 3 academics like sitting in a room somewhere what i would trust is uh something that comes out of like talking to the pope people and asking like how do we make pope more useful right and um or how do we turn pope into something that can actually serve like the our community's particular need to um say yeah you know give out tickets to defcon in a more fair way or like have one or have like five one token per person airdrops right so like start with applications build the system around the application so to let it kind of more organically drop go from there and at some point it's going to standardize and we need more kind of formalization but i think that time is kind of not quite there yet so yeah i have a question also about the sbts because as you said it's based on reputation and we've seen this kind of case with three hours capital where their uh power to borrow and you talk a lot about the under collateralized loans as well where it was based on reputation was based because they uh obtained this uh trust from centralized actors but we've we've seen also that the only loans that were repaid were the decentralized loans for example or something else so by making these loans under collateralized it could be a danger to the protocols as well if we're using speeches in this kind of case so what are your thoughts on this yeah i mean i agree like i think in some ways like loans are one of the more dangerous and kind of even like longer term use cases of this stuff right because uh like so one of the like one of the philosophical challenges with like this concept of blockchain loans right is like in the blockchain community we value these ideas of censorship resistance and not excluding people right but if you want to have under like if you want to have under collateralized loans then under collateralized loans are based on trust and so and if they're based on trust then whoever is doing the trusting is going to have to like use some kind of mechanism to figure out like who who are they actually willing to trust and that requires knowing deep information about people that requires like excluding people and so like really threading the needle between like how do you even do that and at the same time how do you do like not do the bad kinds of exclusion like that intuitively to me that seems like a hard problem right like i do think that there are improvements that we can make but it's like something that we can only probably work toward over time so like for me that like applications of soulbound tokens that excite me are like one i think token airdrops should be like many more of them should be per person or they should be like some square root approach right like the reason you might want to do a square root is if you want to like if you actually want to support like people who have like greater levels of dedication right so you know if you want to do something where like you give someone an airdrop based on you know the square root of like the amount of activity that they've done in some ecosystem like that's both more kind of egalitarian and widely distributed and also um you know actually a good distribu good distribution but that requires like some kind of sold-out token ecosystem to be able to do well and do kind of in a way that's like credible and where third parties can be convinced that you did it fairly uh so start with those kinds of applications bootstrap the ecosystem um you know have like more popes for stuff have more reputation ecosystems um you know have um and just like keep building that ecosystem up more and more and like once it's powerful enough then we'll start to see loans kind of pop up right like but i don't think that you know starting with under collateralized loans is necessarily the right order for things thank you

    so today I am going to be talking about rabbits no rabbits are outside of D5 but I'm going to be talking about other things that are outside of D5 and rabbits um so the vision for ethereum and for I think a lot of the crypto space even Beyond ethereum has always been going Beyond Finance right it's always been about taking these ideas of decentralization and Trust minimization experimenting with building and implementing using many different kinds of mechanisms to areas that go far beyond just a finance right so this was a post that I wrote even back in 2013 this was uh this part of this three-part series and Bitcoin magazines or the Bitcoin magazine article on a decentralized autonomous corporations and the one example there for a decentralized autonomous Corporation this was back before they were called organizations that would actually be useful was this thing that I called identity Corp and it turns out that what this thing is trying to do is basically exactly the same thing as proof of community and it like Works in actually not that difference away from proof of humanity I mean so this was ideas that I've had in 2013 other people have also had been having similar ideas for a long a long period of time so doing like interesting things like this that go beyond just um you know giving people tokens and letting people earn yield on their tokens and tokenizing the yield and entering yield on the on the yield tokens this is a like going Beyond stat has always been like part of the vision and I think for a lot of people even the most interesting part of the vision of general purpose blockchains but today you know we mostly just have Finance right like there's a lot of excitement around defy and there was you know the summer of D5 and uniswap has been very successful yay and compound and synthetics and Ave and the various projects that will get super upset at me for not mentioning them um have all been very successful um see I mentioned you with a universal qualifier you can't complain um so there's definitely this perception that Financial applications uh dominate the ethereum space right um so to clarify right like this is not bad right and you know DFI people are great I mean a D5 dad is great too um but um the chip but this isn't all that um ethereum was trying to do and uh the question is well you know why is uh is finance so dominant and to me like there have always been two primary reasons one of the reasons is that Finance is just the area where centralized technology sucks the most right like I can send you a centralized email and you will get it within one second and like sure maybe various intelligence agencies I'll read it but like at least you could read it and at least you can read it one second from now International Bank wires do not work that way right and you know they're still a notorious way annoying and inefficient and there is a lot of these extra frictions that still persist in the financial system and so the decentralized space just is a bigger Delta from centralized Finance than it was than it is from um centralized other things but at the same time centralized other things do also have problems and I think as we've been seeing centralized other things grow more and more we start to realize more and more what those problems are um and also I think there's the second reason which is that so far transaction fees have been high right like when it costs uh 5.22 cents to do anything the dhns can pay for it the Apes can pay for it the orangutans can pay for it um but you know ens names well okay I mean domain names cost eight dollars so maybe you can pay for it but if we start talking about like decentralized social media things where every tweet becomes an nft then like that can't work when you have 5.22 transaction fees um so the good news is that that problem is a problem which is now being solved right we have the Roll-Ups um you know yay optimism um see we got five of them right um and I'm sure once again and all the others that I have not mentioned um but so scaling is being fixed right and also shorting to kind of increase the scalability of that even further um so the basically now actually is a good time to start thinking about well you know can we go beyond finance and start actually building um all of these Apple all of these other things that we wanted to build um the currents focus on finance is interesting because it it does I think end up kind of a confusing people to some extent um this was a an interesting article that I saw this was a a post I think it was something like remaking positive some worlds and it was a a reply to some of the writings by myself and by some other people um talking about public goods funding and one of the uh an interesting sentences in this that I mentioned is um the at the end of the first paragraph I'm saying uh colloquially these Market Primitives are sometimes described as public infrastructure but if blockchains serve a public today it is primarily one of decentralized Finance fundamentally these token holders share only one object object of concern price now that said that's really confused me right because to me like the purpose of these projects is not price the purpose of these projects is utility price is nice but price should only ever come as a consequence of utility um but at the same time you know in the Topsy crazy doggy world of today you know price does end up dominating in people's minds and this is and so you do get these kinds of kind of Impressions that are misconceptions and like severe misconceptions from the point of view of my ideal world but they are again still like reasonable I guess inferences to make if you just look at you know what people are doing today right like so the challenge is well you know I think these kinds of problems are going to just become less uh it will become more obvious how they're not problems once we have a crypto space where there actually is more utility and more projects and ecosystems that are ecosystems that are building all sorts of various different kinds of utility um but we have to actually get there so ethereum being defined by Defy is better than ethereum being defined by you nothing but it's time to go further but where do we go so I think the goals that we're looking at right is so there's a lot of things that people wants to do but it's also important to kind of think through you know what are some of the things that are both valuable potentially and that might be interesting to focus on in the very near term um and I think the two goals that we have to meet like one is alignment with values so it must be something that people in the community at least enough people in the community to build a thing can actually get behind doing and alignment with needs it needs to be something that is useful for people to do um so what do we have so here's what we have already right we have nfts so this year has been like a year of nfts it's you know there's been a lot of these nfts there's been all sorts of celebrities um launching nfts or at least talking about nfts um there's like what you've I mean I'm sure there's a long list I mean I don't know I was going to say Kim Kardashian but she just but she was pumping ethereum Max at Miami so I think we should just cancel her um foreign on board with canceling Kim Kardashian for the ethereum max sting okay um perfect um cancel Floyd Floyd Mayweather too he also wore the ethereum max shirt Okay so but still you know nfts are interesting they're this interesting cultural phenomenon and they really have attracted a different kind of people to the ethereum space that are interested more in the art side than in the finance side right um yes I talk a lot about ens and I think ens is actually a pretty amazing application and it's an amazing application for some fascinating reasons right like it's it is an identifier that you can have that that you control it's an identifier that is like yours and it isn't controlled by you know the like Twitter or Google or Facebook and it's an identifier that can work across different applications like if I'm or you know you can use that to send me if um then you can use that to talk to me on status well you can use that to interact with me in other applications right so we have these kind of identifiers that are useful across many applications and they do not have a yes A Central controller and their identifiers that people actually wants to use right like an email is also a multi-platform identifier but nobody is like enthusiastic about using um you know vitalik gmail.com as their name like Yay Gmail Pride that does not exist for some reason but the reason why you can say what we have already is just nfts the nfts are so amazing is because technically ens names are nfts um but hopefully we'll have more more interesting types of nfts in the future as well so what else can we have right so here's one interesting category that I personally care about um building out the ethereum social media ecosystem so why social media right like why is social media like such an interesting thing to focus on look first of all I'm not the only one saying this right like right preceding me there was uh you know those lovely uh clear Rose presentation and talking about like using the decentralized chord to do moderation um there was like study was um I think announced that he was interested in like building some kind of ethereum based Twitter so other people are also thinking this right but you know like why like what's interesting about crypto social media um so first of all there's a widespread belief that existing social media platforms suck and that we need better ones and this is true for different reasons um so one is uh centralized and arbitrary censorship and manipulation I don't have to explain that one hopefully low quality of discourse also don't have to explain that one and of course like the concept of Engagement and the kinds of Engagement that are favored are very misaligned with quality um so I need better social media too right so this is a a use case that I can perceive as being important very personally right so here's me sending one of my tweets recently where I attempt to explain vertical trees that I'm just linking to my blog post talking about vertical trees and the replies herb dollar T cyber when the bridge between Doja at HTE when anyone know mini Shiva token this is 100 morning oh sorry morning okay um is that like does that mean it did ozone enter your head yeah did I translate correctly no I actuated sorry Michaels I'm not um capitalized pancakes are always the best for breakfast um okay no real like so another example of this right so a retroactive public goods funding um is an ethrock poll something in Turkish unfortunately my yet turkey I I know basically zero Turkish um at all um oh when will we see one eat equals 10K um by the end of 2021 who here thinks that we'll see what if this 10K by the end of 2021. well so plot twist this guy this um this guy is from Taiwan and Taiwan dollars are 30 times cheaper than US dollars so you guys all just said that Heath will be down to 300 US Dollars by the end of 2021. no no I I just made that up um another example why sharding is great demystifying the technical properties if I request ethereum um picture of some guy is that like Neo or Morpheus or like the the sub Jumanji guy I I forget that's great but what is optimism coming sort out your coin mate Harmony is over one check it out okay guys Harmony dollar one remember this is a very a very important coin someone tweeted about it in response to me you guys have to check it out so basically like even I personally would really love to see a social media platform that just allows higher quality engagement period um so you know if someone could solve that then you know that would be amazing uh so why social media right so cryptotech is uh I think actually well suited to solve a lot of these problems so credible neutrality in what is one of the things that I think a lot of people want out of social media and blockchains are good at building a credibly neutral mechanisms censorship resistance blockchains are censorship resistance the concept of shared open state that you can have platforms where content is either Unchained or if it can't be Unchained for scaling reasons it it can be a kind of floating or floating around peer-to-peer networks some things like whisper or waku um and then you have this oh this public open State and then you have these kind of different views going into that state um so you can have architectures that are less monolithic you can have more separation between different layers and like there's an opportunity to build more and interesting things if you do it that way um built-in economic layer so crypto has a built-in economic layer you know you have coins and you can make your own coins and here to do a mechanism design right so it's like there's a natural fit um examples of like crypto social media that are not ethereum and that are not ghost towns exist um I don't approve I don't fully approve of like the economics of everything on here but you know like these things are not ghost towns right like bitcloud not a ghost town like steam high voice if you go on them like you know they're not ghost towns uh so there's like there is evidence at least in my view of this existing demand for some kind of a decentralized social media thing so directions to explore um decentralized content and separating out the contents from different views that can be views on the same content that filter it um prediction market like mechanisms um so the stuff that queeros talked about is like to some extent of alien in that direction but there can be lots of different spins on it right I think the core principle of like introducing prediction market like things is to encourage posts that look good one year from now and not just today um who here has um who remem made a coronavirus take one year ago that they're not proud of today who here has seen someone else making a coronavirus take one year ago they're not proud of today okay there we go see so like uh you know other we know what the problem is the problem like the problem is other people but uh like the the con the concept of uh lasting qual you know encouraging things that actually have long-term value and that aren't just like let's like spin it out so it goes viral and we get some engagement and it turns out it's like it's actually total junk like trying to move beyond that well maybe there are mechanisms that can do that um civil resistance um so you know if we don't want a system dominated by spam then you want simple resistance you want to make it difficult to create an unlimited number of accounts an interesting direction is community focused so forums that are less about trying to create Like This Global water cooler where that tries to like pretends that everyone is two meters away from each other um but more like things that may that allow people to more easily form communities and even kind of enforce rules and enforce limits within their communities even just forums where you can only speak if you prove that you're part of some Dow or you prove that you're part of some community that you have you know could be some number of coins it could be a pope you know it could be a could be some other kind of membership token um like these are like crypto is an ecosystem and we have a very easy ability to do these kinds of things plug-in so this is um another thing that I personally have cared a lot about recently so this is the idea that like you should be able to use your ethereum wallet to sign into things right like we have signed in with Google we have sign in with Twitter why not sign in with ethereum there are projects that are actually starting to do this and there's even like recently we have been trying to promote an effort to standardize this and make it and make it easier to do um and the reason why I think this is valuable once again a few reasons right so first of all today is centralized login providers like are in my opinion worst of Both Worlds in terms of centralization and decentralization so you have a centralized Corp that owns your identity they can see everything you have no privacy you have the risk of arbitrary de-platforming but at the same time like why do you need centralization well if you screw up then maybe the big centralized Daddy can help you well it turns out that like from my first hand and second-hand experience actually talking to Big centralized daddies the big centralized daddies are often too lazy to actually help you right like if you lose your accounts in a lot of these services like often it's extremely hard to actually get it back so um ethereum accounts that are social recovery wallets potentially can out-compete the centralized providers and the decentralized providers on both fronts right so you have both better self-sovereignty and better recovery um the concept of self-custody public key authentication and self-custody public key encryption it's been a dream since the 1990s right like we always wanted you know everyone could have their own pgp key and we can encrypt things to each other but this has been very hard to actually get adopted in practice right so we even needed ethereum to get cryptographic keys into enough people's hands um allow with with blockchains uh specifically we can get uh you can switch your keys you can repoints an ens name you can do social recovery you can do smart contract wallets you can do multi-six and of course you know we have this standard for a wallet that by which anyone can have their key and that you can actually plug it and use the wallet right like if lots of people have metamask lots of people have the status well that lots of people have all these you know all the various other wallets so there we have a standard of some kind so um ethereum login you know One login for many services it's also a username one other reason why using things like a Google login and Twitter login is nice for web developers is that they provide anti-civil protection it's difficult to just create thousands of fake accounts and you know if you get banned for spam create thousands more fake accounts right because you know they do some kind of some level of you know of antisable protection and make it harder for you to create lots of accounts ethereum also does that right so in ethereum you know there is economic civil protection um there is proof of humanity there is Pope there's you know once again this entire ecosystem of tools that exist for this purpose and we can use them and also ethereum login is a natural stepping stone to an ethereum social space um once again there's an RFP with the ethereum foundation and the ens team if anyone wants to help um please check it out um building the attestation ecosystem so this is another one of these things it's not so much an application in the sense of like one app that one person builds but it's like a category of application right this is just the idea that you can have these attestations you can have people just sign a message that says I believe X about accounts Y and you can just publish that and whoever owns accounts why can actually have that at the station it doesn't always it doesn't have to be published on chain if you want to preserve privacy but they can have that information and then if they want to prove it to someone else then you know you can zero knowledge prove it and this is the sort of thing that has been a dream for a long time right but we actually have this growing ecosystem of things that are moving in the direction of being able to do that right once again there's proof of humanity there's the pope there's uh various projects doing like thank you for your participation type nfts open certs in Singapore is like actually running various ethereum Enterprise projects like a lot of projects in the ethereum Enterprise ecosystem are ultimately about making attestations about individuals making adaptations about events providing like receipts for events that happened and so we have this ecosystem of just things that are happening that are cryptographically signed that are cryptographically provable and look we can have more right and we can build more infrastructure to actually you know make all of these things be provable on chain um well voting should not be provable and chain but that's for reasons that I already talked about in other places so I won't get into that now if you want and you should be able to attest to things and use your knowledge proofs for privacy at the same time right so you can make a proof that says like prove that it that I have reputation score of at least 100 according to this metric and prove that I am a unique account but do not prove anything or do not reveal any other information right zero knowledge proofs their magic you can do this sort of thing so like this is an ecosystem that actually can be built can be built out more um git coin is kind of is interesting right in how like they are experimenting with these attestations and not giving you higher trust bonuses if you have like I guess higher levels of verification but like this can be done in a more cross-platform you know like not centralized and more privacy preserving way as well so that's one set of ideas another set of ideas that I personally am excited about is retroactive public goods funding um so I Know Carl talked about it yesterday but I like the topic so I'm going to talk about it again um so once again yay you know new forms of public goods funding um so what is retroactive public goods funding right so basically the idea here is we yes is this concept that instead of funding projects like or having some kind of centralized mechanism that funds projects based on what it thinks is going to be promising we have an ecosystem that funds projects that were already successful and then you basically create the equivalent of a prediction Market where people can fund those projects in advance based on a prediction that what some project succeeds it will get the retroactive Grant so the idea would be that we set up a dow in the the blog post from yesterday and we call it was called the results Oracle and the Dow just judges what projects were valuable according to what community schools and it judges after the facts right so you might say um you know we can judge right now that EIP 1559 is valuable or maybe we want to judge that a month from now we can judge that well your two protocols were valuable we can judge that you know unit swap was valuable and we can make these kind of retrospective judgments and then there's this concept of projects tokens where if you have a project then you can launch a projects token and you can use for this projects token to basically get either get funding for the project ahead of time or you can just allocate that project's token to people who have made contributions to that project and that encourages upfront contribution and then if that token trades on the market then like whoever actually whoever buys up that token or whoever does work to get that token will be rewarded in the future if their prediction about this project being important turns out to be correct right so this is basically like as I think like Carl Linda Jinx I am yesterday it said creating the equivalent of how the startup ecosystem Works where you have Investments backed by the possibility of an it but for public goods so the goal here is to encourage work and funding on things that I call entrepreneurial public goods right entrepreneurial public goods are public goods so projects that benefit a large and unselective group of people so you can't like pick and choose you know you get it you get it you get it you don't get it you get it you don't get it it just you know you it's either out there and it benefits everyone or it's not out there and it benefits no one but at the same time projects that are only seen as important after they are built so entrepreneurial public goods are hard because markets and governments both tends to system systemically fail at them right so markets fail at entrepreneurial public goods for the same reason markets fail at every other public good there's the Fremont rider problem and governments fail at entrepreneurial public goods because being institutions they're either to if they're centralized they're too exclusionary and if they're decentralized they're too conformist right so there isn't a really a good kind of funding channel for people people to kind of get rewarded for building things that are not recognized as important at the beginning but only become recognized as important once the whole the whole project is already done and everyone can already see the benefit so examples in ethereum EIP 1559 so EAP 1559 it's launching two weeks from now yay right now the idea for EIP 1559 was originally came about in I think it was like 2017 or 2018. right so the idea was published then what happened the community just kind of sat on it for a year a few people recognized that it's important but no one was working on it and because and no one thought that they felt empowered to work on it and no one felt that they would be rewarded for working on it and so people sat on it and then eventually a bit more research was done later then people sat on it more then eventually um you know there was some more research done and then finally the community kind of staged this mask protest where they basically just flooded one of the gay coin grounds and they just redirected like half of an entire Bitcoin matching pool over to an EIP 1559 Grant and by then you know there actually was this big Community signal that EAP 1559 is really really valuable and we need to actually do it but it took a long time right you know imagine a world where you work on EIP 1559 had actually started even if by some small team a year just somewhere in the ecosystem that really believed in it one year earlier um Layer Two scaling um so Layer Two scaling right now it's a big space but two years ago it was a small space right and you know even before that like there were teams like for example the optimism team before they were plasma group and when they were plasma group like people theoretically knew that layer 2 scaling was good but no one really felt the urgency and you know some some people did donate a couple hundred thousand dollars to them but you know we're not going now the uh OMG team uh supported them right some a couple of other people supported them but like there wasn't really that much more support right there wasn't really that much kind of incentive actually encouraging them to start thinking about and start working on those problems then now imagine if plasma group instead of being like three to five people had been able to scale up to 10 to 20 people way back in 2018. they would have figured out that plasma is a dead end a year or later they would have probably switched to optimistic Roll-Ups a year earlier and we probably would be Asia you know we would have been selling tickets for efcc on a fully functional and stable optimistic roll-up even right now easy to easy tools another good example um you know stake just infrastructure to make staking easier for users is something that we're increasingly recognizing is really important but that there wasn't really a good proactive effort for it um uniswap right launched in 2018 nobody cared about it for a long time then in 2020 um you know all the the talking heads on uh you know on Twitter that consider themselves to be very smart started talking about oh it's a summer of D5 now and oh amms are the future this story has a bit of a happy ending because uniswap managed to convince Paradigm and that they had some hope of having a business model and eventually they actually did have a business model but this is not the average story right like the there's plenty of public goods that never have a chance of actually getting a business model when they're just stuck being pure public goods um so why retro funding right basically I think the core idea here is that decentralized decision making is much better at retrospective decisions than it is at prospective decisions right like if you just take like a sort of a vote of 100 people and you ask them well what are important things that were done in the last 50 years they might give some wrong answers they might give some crazy answers but you know they could give relatively reasonable answers now if you ask a random group of 100 people what are things that will be important for the next 50 years you're probably going to get total junk right so the idea here is to basically use decentralized decision making retrospectively and allow the people to start and just individually participate in and even speculate on projects prospectively and so those two mechanisms they kind of function according to different principles right like there is both this decentralized community driven retroactive evaluation but then also a retro funding ecosystem preserves a role for leadership it preserves a role for individual Vision Vision it preserves a role for small teams that are just the that are just really sure and they have a really good idea about what is going to be important gives them space to actually build out their vision and if they're if they're lucky actually get a reward and it it creates a reward for making uh predictions about what the future will need correctly so I think the core principle here right and I think this is one of these kind of principles that I think a lot of the crypto space is sort of behind without realizing that it's behind is the idea that like we can be pro-social without being conformist right like the usual divide is you know we talk about individualism versus collectivism and individualism gets criticized as being like less pro-social and being like a like encouraging people to be competitive against each other and fight these kind of Wars of everyone against each other collectivism gets criticized as just being this you know boring gray conformist thing that's just like stepping on your boot forever but what if you can you could be pro-social but at the same time like you don't like there are different ways to be pro-social and you can be pro-social in a way that's different from the way that everyone else is pro-social you can even be pro-social in a way that other people don't recognize is pro-social until it's actually until what you've done is actually done um so I think retroactive public goods funding is like one of those ideas that kind of exists in that top right quadrant right uh so that's I think uh one of so this is also one of the reasons why I think retroactive public goods funding is interesting um quadratic funding I think also falls in there right because with quadratic funding you can the point is to funds public goods but it still leaves open the room for different subgroups of the population to have different ideas about what is what is uh the public good um so you know the one question you might ask is well are there more interesting ideas in that top right corner so retroactive public goods funding is already happening I'm so I think two days ago this was uh quietly announced um the EIP 1559 supporter and Patron nft so uh the there's a group that made an nft and it's going to be sold and all proceeds well I mean you can read the the the screenshot yourself right yeah I I managed to actually screenshot the video at the exact time that it stopped at this phrase um yeah all proceeds go to those Comedia AP 1559 happen um so this is also an interesting experiment and like rewarding um EIP 1559 contributors retroactively um and also the experiment in retroactive public goods funding from the uh from the optimism team um so there I'm sure there are plenty of things that look I would say deserve retroactive rewards today um one other interesting example ZK snarks right that this is technology that we really depend on and there are a lot of very smart people like even the starkware team and um Ellie Benson and his team is one example there's also just plenty of academics in all sorts of places that worked very hard and in some cases even worked for decades to get all of the different pieces of technology that are needed to make ZK snarks possible happen today right and there's this like very long chain of citations right to have us to be able to use a CK snark like you know you need you might want to use polunk and Planck was built by the Aztec team and Planck is based on polynomial commitments and there's kcg commitments that were created by Kate zafarucha and Goldberg work and then those are built on elliptic curves and elliptic curves are created by these other academics from 30 years ago and then zero knowledge proofs themselves or this theory created by theoretical cryptography that slowly grew over the last 30 years and then you have the people who invented the PCP theorem back in the 1980s and 1990s right look there's all of these people doing War all of this amazing work that we now recognize is just absolutely key to making a the next step of this multi-hundred billion dollar industry possible but you know in a sane World there would be there would be a reward for putting Decades of your life into things that become that become uh you know finally valuable so a lot of promise for retroactive public goods funding as well um I think it's an idea that's interesting for the crypto space because the crypto space has a lot of public goods and because the crypto space is just cares about mechanism design experimentation so let's uh let's funds more richer let's fund more public goods and let's fund it retroactively and like Yay you know we can like create like create the public God of public goods um so key takeaways right so the ethereum ecosystem has to expand Beyond like just making tokens that help with trading other tokens right because they're like like in some ways like if you just take like just this narrow thing that is defying you just like to keep you know pushing it to infinity and you keep letting like you know the a16z and the z32w and like the AK-47 and whatever these funds are and they just like keep like you keep going forever and then like you're just gonna get like tokens that give you profit from yield farming other currencies that are Financial derivatives between other yield farming tokens and this other thing that's a prediction Market of yield farming tokens on top of stable coins and like some these things are valuable up to you know layer one and Layer Two but once he gets to layer three it's like yeah and then once he gets away you're sick so like you're actually increasing the chance the the financial instability and the risk of this whole thing is going to collapse and like potentially get a couple Regulators angry right so let's not just do D5 um and doing not just a Defy is uh yeah um yeah it's uh it's already happening right but we can do more so moving beyond DFI is not about being against E5 right so I actually think the best applications the most interesting ethereum applications are going to combine elements of finance and non-finance one simple example like ens ens it has like it has fixed fees and for fixed fees to be possible in a decentralized way you need you know either a stable coin or a price Oracle ens itself like registering domains um it requires money and that's a currency currencies are the simplest form of defy um if we want some kind of decentralized content moderation Dao that might need incentives and those incentives might require a token of some kind right so applications that combine elements of Finance but Finance not just as an engine itself but as a tool to make the non-finance and to make the ultimate utility happen I think applications like that are the future um so what can we do right so turning accounts and like ethereum accounts into fully fledged profiles so I mentioned the attestation ecosystem ethereum logins ethereum social at the same time also um do like actually keep working on you know social recovery wallets and multi-sig wallets and better security Technologies so that you know you're not going to lose your entire ethereum like or online identity if your house burns down in your 20 and the 24 words don't survive um talking not just about D5 but also about D gov um you know quadratic funding quadratic voting I saw the git coin Dow use quadratic voting which I think is amazing um the Retro funding you know are there going to be other ideas um I think this is one of those things that's really worth thinking about so there's a lot of things that we can do right and well let's let's start building let's like do more experiments and uh you know maybe a few years from now and we'll have a lot of just really exciting things to talk about that are providing just all kinds of like very diverse and real value to all kinds of people not just within the ethereum ecosystem but you know also going far beyond it as well thank you [Laughter] of course yeah thank you for for this great presentation uh so when you talk about the retroactive Public Funding like how do you set basically the price at the beginning do you see that more like an As an X prize equivalent or something like that how do you think about it I mean I think like extra index price is a good example but I think the important thing that this mechanism has to provide is that the prices have to be ongoing and they have to be persistent so that people can start new projects in new areas on the assumption that if they succeed then they then they will get a prize in the future right like the X prizes or and like existing prices they tends to be oriented around a very specific goal which I think is good and I think it's valuable but I also like I my what I want to see is also like the for the market or like people people's independent decision making to be not just for like what is the way to solve a specific problem but also for like what are the problems that need to be solved in the first place right so like if you come up with something that people don't even realize is valuable today and then it becomes valuable five years from now like you should be able to get a prize from that and so like I think you know the existing kind of work and thought going into prices is definitely like a good start but I want to take that further as well and then in terms of like what mechanism will decide how the prices are distributed and I think that's kind of deliberately left a little bit blank because I think doing like so if we a perfect solution to that problem would be a perfect solution to the governance problem and Community is very far from perfect solutions to the governance problem right so we do have to I think kind of be humble and realistic about it and approach that problem more experimentally and iteratively um so start with something simple see how it goes and then just keep improving it over time as we see how it actually collides with the real world hmm hi vitalik hi I was thinking maybe instead of canceling Kim Kardashian we offer her like something that maybe she could um join the community for instance she has a closet full of clothing I know there's some fashionistas in here I was hanging out with them last night um and I know vinay Gupta is working on materem maybe uh tokenizing her closet for instance and then adding value to clothing so we recognize it in terms of a theory like its value in tokens instead of um because this is very valuable to women especially where I'm from Texas it's like our clothes are very valuable so it's instead of canceling her maybe we invite her in offering her different um that would be great too um I think the one Province though is that like I really want these nft things to benefit not just the celebrities themselves but also find some way to benefit wider Society too so you know if it like no no if she makes an uh if she makes an nft and a large portion of uh let's say for example some portion of the rewards go to charity and this ends up funding some you know really awesome thing that like empowers poor people and you know in like say yeah the Selfies as you're Africa then like I think that would be amazing and I would be the first to like give some kind of official on canceling um so no no if things like that can happen then uh that would be really delightful thank you um yourself um Heights OH um um after this zika roll up we're going to to be implemented and um yeah and some others several steps will go through and this ethereum level will become the level It Is wishable by all of us I think will it not be the problem by the governance so somehow take the control over because like I've heard the today's presentation about human recognition and by just along we think and yes it is a private blockchain and plus the recognition without naming a name but if you take some other database and basically come things put things together and everything what's going to happen maybe a privacy issue and right then so I think like a couple of things there right like one I think it would be better if these things are done like on public chains instead of on private chains just so that they can be used by everyone instead of just a small group of people and then for a privacy issue like I think private Chain versus public change should not matter because a well-designed system of attestations should not be putting personally identifiable information on chain at best it should be putting hashes of pro of privately identifiable information on chain and if you wants to prove it to someone else that you have something that matches a hash with a zero knowledge proof you can but if you don't send someone that proof then look they're not going to see what the hash represents it's just a random number right so I think like it is definitely important to design these systems privately and one of the reasons why I would want the ethereum community to be kind of actively involved and do it designing these systems well is because if they're not designed well then like someone else with some with very limited technical understanding in a very narrow mind profit motive is going to design them badly and that would be a you know unfortunate now the next of course challenge is like you know if these systems have decentralized governance of some kinds then like what if that governance gets corrupted somehow that is a genuine concern and like I'm worried about this stuff even today right like I'm worried about how even a lot of these like defy governance tokens you know there's like five or ten people that can have that can control half the supply and then they can just like make a proposal and like to make force the projects to do what they want like it's uh I think hardening these systems so that they are more resistance to attack and so that like potentially even like putting a speed limit on them and like designing them in such a way that changes can only happen slowly adding more kinds of safeguards adding more diverse sets of stakeholders like these are all things that we need to also focus and think about more so science scientific research is a good use case of public good that could be funded with the Retro funding and and for example you could give value backwards to uh impact factor of Publications and other microcontributions like peer reviews data collection that usually are not valued economically but so I wanted to know your thoughts about it but also how do you think this could be integrated with the a prospective funding since the problem of science actually to have money to start with projects now I think scientific research is a great example um actually one very timely example of this is like take covid vaccines right like coveted vaccines I think have provided like literally trillions of dollars of value to humanity even right now by just allowing um but allowing us to get past the whole covert thing much more quickly and if you look at the amount of money that governments are putting into them it's like tiny right it was like a few billion here a few billion there it was like it felt as though people were just like stuck in kind of like a standard procedure followed the rules mode and they didn't realize you know the enormity of just like how big a benefit could come of this and like the needs to just actually throw out all stops and put everything into it right so this is look that would be one example where I think like the people who were responsible and just putting in that hard work to make the whole vaccine thing happen like they should be very uh well rewarded for something that like we very clearly recognize today right that um you know if that did not exist then I mean like billions of people's lives would be would be significantly worse for an entire year and I think many other kinds of science are definitely similar medical research in particular right like good medical research has the potential to improve a lot of people's lives um I mean this is also important for me personally because I'm a longevity and anti-aging person and I think like I really believe that with the Right medical research we could be seeing like people just regularly live well past the century by within 40 years and that's these are the sorts of things that could like provide a really huge amount of value but right now there really isn't anything encouraging the people doing all of the kind of hard work like five steps on Upstream of the good outcomes right so I think that's important another thing that's also I think interesting in like in academic spaces is that in academic spaces there's often this kind of web of contributions right so like I'm less familiar with biomedicine but in cryptography as I mentioned right like ZK snarks depend on the code they depend on elliptic curve pairings they depend on kcg commitments that depends on up to curve parent carings that depends on elliptic curves they depend on arithmetization it depends on the PCP theorem and there's this like big graph of important stuff that was done 20 to 30 years ago and that like figuring out how to actually kind of extract that graph like I mean there is a citation graph in Academia which is actually nice right but like trying to kind of make that model stronger and more robust and extend into other places and I think I think there's really interesting problems hmm hey vitalik hello over here yes anyway other side oh yeah just uh just to let you know because your talk had a lot of um uh points about attestations and we just launched the uh well we announced the ethereum attestation service today and it's it's a public good it's uh open protocol it's a registry for anyone who wants to make any attestations on uh on the blockchain uh the the attestations the schemas can also be uh made made there and there's a schema registry so a lot of the things that you spoke about um could potentially use it it's free it's open to use um there's no token or profit motive so take a look at it uh that's uh amazing I mean I think my my advice would be to kind of work with the community and see if like you can get you know the existing attestations like the you know the proof of humanities and the popes and like actually yeah like just get everything together into a framework yeah that would be awesome the time.

  - Video: "Keynote Speech Vitalik Buterin at Devcon5 Osaka - Japan"
    so I wanted to we're going to start this presentation with any kind of simpler question which is just what did situated that's anyway right so who here uh sort of a point through here is aware of the fact that Satoshi created Bitcoin okay so some she created big one right but what makes Bitcoin interesting now the way that you might hear a lot of people describing it is that Satoshi is the first person who solved this long aversive 25 year old computer science problem called the Byzantine generals problem right you didn't hear you did find a bunch of people saying things like this that the solution to the visit his generals problem was invented developed by a man group I'm open bracket I didn't yet know the course dragnet who goes by the name solution Nakamoto the Byzantine generals problem was called unsolvable and so Satoshi sidestepped it many authors have written about the decay of Western civilization and held a loss of power causes society as the disintegrate and Satoshi fixes this problem currently so this is not true the visit the generals problem will solve by I'm a wonderful fellow named SS really important to you and then a 1982 so in the paper that introduced the visiting generals problem he basically provide an algorithms for how a set of parties that all once we agree on something the zombie sadena so I'm gonna buy a choice between some of us up large choices and do so and can interior cemetery easily even under assuming up to a third of them are malicious and even assuming like no assumptions about network synchrony and all of these things right so there's a bunch of different solutions to the innocent in general sub problem indeed visiting generals problem paper and I encourage people to read it so if visiting generals problem was solved at the very beginning and if there were a whole bunch of ways of doing T centralized consensus for 25 years before Bitcoin and 50 years before proof of work started to be used for anything then what did Satoshi really invent since every state events in Complete Genomics so what is curve to economic story curves of economics is basically you know use of economic census to provide guarantees about applications so your kid if you can encrypt aletan Allah makes us being and if the use of upended economics and game theoretic reasoning as a kind of appendage to cryptographic reasoning I mean so cryptographic reasoning allows me to and if believe certain things conditional and some assumptions that basically claim that the adversary must not have a computer that's bigger than the size of the observable universe and that's all really nice but crypto economics allows you to have other kinds of guarantees that cryptography can't provide but because of the types of guarantee is that purposely we can you know make sure is trying to provide there they're not cryptographic guarantees in standard guarantee is conditional on certain kinds of economic assumptions so for example the assumption that apply for will continue running the liveness a also known as censorship resistance is something that can be provided by economics cannot be provided by photography even the assumption that Anakin to decentralized consensus festival come to consensus it is something that cannot be guaranteed by cryptography it can only be guaranteed by some kind of model that says things about the motivations of participants in the what the platform so what chains are crypto economic protocols here's a watch in you have watch and five of those walks are in one chain one of those blocks in a kind of off to the side in the wrong chain and in watching he wants to encourage more miners to create blocks that extend the correct change and you do not want to people to create blocks that just go off to the side to the side and make a different chain and confuse people so how do we do this with economic incentives now it's actually a bit more subtle than just talking about incentives right Bitcoin uses group to economics to solve two problems well the first problem is what I call the witness an assignment problem but you might also have heard about basically the same problem under the name civil resistance so here's the problem right we've had these eft algorithms for a long time these algorithms that say you can get together 15 nodes have them send a bunch of messages to each other and as long as less than five of them are malicious then the system is going to come to consensus and if you can make assumptions about the maximum amount of time that messages can will take to pass between these nodes that instead of tolerating up to for malicious you can tolerate up to seven malicious and that's like even better many of those it turns out that if you didn't allow even stronger like really strong security assumptions you didn't tolerate all the way up to 13 vehicle issues but that's a topic for another day so we've had these algorithms for a long time right and so we have these centralized consensus what's the problem what what has a mistake you know and the reason is ultimately in that even in a system that has say 15 different parties you have to have some mechanism for choosing who these 15 parties are right you could say oh it's like the 15 big major eggs who's here trusts at least 11 of the top 15 major banks it could be 15 of the top world governments were here trust the least 11 of the top 50 world's so this is this is a challenge right if he wants to create a system that actually will be accepted by large constituencies around the around the world then it's hard to kind of create this set of 50 of 15 people that like everyone will agree if they go actually we can trust at least a lot of it's hard to come up with a set of actors running the system that actually is kind of credible mutual right and this is the problem that roof of work and proof of stake so cleverly solved right basically what we report in front of Steve do as they say well instead of pre-selecting 15 people that will run the system we're but we're going to kind of de facto do is we're going to say anyone who publishes a certificate that kind of cryptographically who proves that they've keep and I computed some large amounts of mathematical work gets to join the set so if you can stall like some extremely complicated mathematical problem and you publish a solution to this problem said I you're part of the set a river of stake if you have a bunch of coins and you send the risk points to the deposit contract that I am part of the set and so instead of the kind of pre selecting 50 people that everyone trusts we create this headed open provisional system where anyone can join and participate but then we we the participants by the number of economic resources that they contributed brancelet proof-of-work the they're kind of the weight of the impacts that you have on the consensus is proportional to the amount of computing power that you're bringing to the table and a group of stake is proportional to the number of coins and both of those things take a lot of economic resources to get the reason we can't just allow everyone to join and give them one vote is because well on the internet nobody know he's here a dog and on the internet nobody knows you're a virtual machine inside of my computer with ten thousand virtual machines where that computer's run is run fight a dog look this is the problem that we're sure that we're trying to solve right so economics actually does like do a very good job of solving this problem the kind of creating this set of actors and this kind of set of assignments of voting power to basically an open provisional a set of actors that actually is very economically difficult to take over and become 51% of so this is what for the word solve so this is basically the innovation that made big would possible the innovation that makes theory impossible and proof of stake is a new fundamentally in the exact same spirit except instead of burning a bunch of electricity to to prove that if you have economic resources you're just like waits to be audited the address for your deposit at some point since your question so this is the first problem and the second problem is an incentive problem right you have a bunch of provision less actors and some of them might be wonderful people and some of them might might be people in some country that can bind really cheaply that you have in you have like no don't really understand what their psychology is some of them look like the big big corporations some of them might might be hobbyists some some of them might be like hackers Nicky and I have gain access to computing resources and like these are at of disparate groups of people and we can know look I know very little about what motivates them well what's the thing that motivates a lot of people economic incentives right like we know that people and all these disparate regions like money and wants to gain more it's generally people that don't like money and want to get more are not going to be the ones that have eaten up into the economic resources to make up 51% of the network in the first place so we can kind of use economic incentives as a way of driving another driving this wide disparate group of participants to participate in the network in good ways instead of participating in the network in bad ways so these are both kind of crazy use of the use cases of krypton we cannot make Sandler use that Nick wonder use in aetherium to houston basically you know every major public wants it so incentives pretty queer if you make them walk that's part of the main chain you get a reward and you have to pay some electricity costs to make them walk but the reward is going to be a bit bigger than the cost and if you make a walk that's not part of the main chain you have to pay a cost and so if you're making blocks you have an incentive to kind of continue to extend the chain with everyone else who's here understands this yay so group do we do not makes is great because cryptography lets us prove things with very minimal assumptions about behavior actually without assumptions about behavior terms of economics allows us to prove things with minimal assumptions about participants so the sub an assumption that like they're motivated by economic incentives and actually system skin Evensen works even if people are not willing to I'm just motivated by economic incentives all you need to assume is just an upper bound on like basically how much money attachments have that they're willing to burn and both of these assumptions are pretty ideal for decentralized and transmitted by systems so what are the security goals that we have in terms of economic assessment right so first of all we want the correct execution of the protocol to be a robust equilibrium so you have Nash equilibriums that basically say if everyone is following the protocol it should be in each individual participants interests also follow the protocol well we need something that's even more robust we wants the incentive to follow the protocol - needs to be pretty substantial and we want the equilibrium is to survive even as some sort of a significant percentage of the participants start doing nasty things seeking to acknowledge the kind of games that are perturbed by third parties like attackers making bribes and also ideal way to just maximize the cost of a successful attack so if a successful attack happens then someone who cool cause the attacks haven't wasted a lot of money there's different security models that you can have so for example you can have different kinds of assumptions about participants you can assume participants are honest you can assume that they're rational but they're not coordinated so they want to make money but they're not kind of colluding with each other to make as much money as possible you can assume the are coordinated to clear assumptions applies to my super majority of participants no majority adjusted or minority assumptions about network is a network synchronous our messages guaranteed to get across with in some mud very strict time bound is their partial synchronous era completely synchrony we have no idea how long messages will take to arrive outside influences so if there's an attacker that's willing to make economic rewards to participants already in the system is there a balance on the budget the amount they need willing to pay is there a balance on the amount that they actually have to pay if an attack happens so 1 comma negative critique of the crypto economic approach which focuses on incentives rather than focusing on honest majorities is basically like what about attackers that just have this really large extra protocol incentive like participants that basically just wants to watch the world work right this could be I keep watching this could be a government saying this is going to be just hackers that take over and want to have some fun so the the critique here basically says well we're assuming that you have these participants that are motivated by economic incentives and what if there's people that just wants to break the thing regardless of how how much money is on the table if they don't break the thing so there's two replies that s right one of them is that the traditional ethical honest majority driven approach actually is even more realistic because it assumed it even more unrealistic because it assumes that the majority of the participants are kind of Al Jarreau altruistically honest they're honest even if they have in centrist dishonest which is even more unrealistic than the economic approach right it's basically saying that the more than half of this network that that in order to into you have to like put in a huge pile of money with the expectation of getting more money but more than one half of these participants are going to just voluntarily for real forgo opportunities to save money and this has already been falsified right so for example a couple of years ago there was this some work that happens on the Bitcoin blockchain where miners stopped verifying blogs because they just assumed that everyone else was verifying blocks and so one in help walked on in and a bunch of other blogs got built on top of it and the ability xbox eyes to get thrown out right so we know for a fact that participants in these networks are willing to be lazy if they can get away with it and the second argument here is that while pushing the cost of attack as high as possible matters right because the higher the cost of an attack the lower the risk that there is an attacker with enough resources so not just incentive you also need resources and enough will to men give actually attack the system actually exists so another kind of version of this critique basically says well you can't assume that people don't have an incentive to break the chain because if they have an incentive to break the chain then you can just like hedge on financial markets and you can kind of have basically make money on derivatives from we're watching the watching Bitcoin price drop and so does it really matter if like 2 million of your youth get burned if you're 2 billions back by doing a short on both attacks yeah like a lot of people say this right as an argument for why I don't get on the bottle is broken but the problem with this is right then first of all there is a member in some maximum you did learn by breaking the chain right there like liking financial markets are not infinitely deep and the attacker is motivated to already have taken this maximum trick the attack if an attacker is going to try to break the chain they're going to be motivated to like me not just enough money to cover their losses but as much money as possible to benefit from the attack and there is kind of some fixed number that that is the amount of money that they can make and so if the cost of attack is higher than this number than you've won yeah if the cost of attack is lower than this number well the lower it is that the more of a risk that this kind of attack actually will happen right so there is an a very significant benefit to increasing the cost of attack and so increasing the amount of like basically kind of corresponding outside the system incentives you know you need to have in order to actually be willing to attack the champ so like for example if you're going to attack the chain then it's going to be fairly easy to make say a few thousand worth of even profits anonymously on decentralized markets but if the cost of attack goes up to a million Eve then making the corresponding amount on financial markets anonymously and getting away with it is going to be vastly harder right so the more you put you push off the requirement for how much money they need to make to offset the cost of an attack that the harder and attend the more unrealistic and attack becomes so we can look at group of work in a kind of crypts we can on the context right so you can look at it like models that say the majority of the network is honest or the majority of the network is uncoordinated or we can talk about the amount of budget in attack needs to have to be able to make an attack or we can talk about the cost of an attack of it succeeds and then we can also talk about kind of different assumptions about network sacredness so yeah or two messages arrive immediately - they arrive after 1 minute - dear wife after 10 minutes so the first column is just the usual kind of 51% arguments and the longer layer of the network we can see the more the percentage goes up because the honest Network like sometimes accidentally makes they'll blocks the second column uncoordinated the reason why not Collin what kind of looks much harsher is because of selfish minding and the cost of an attack is zero because well if you make an attacking you succeed then sure you have to go eat a bunch and like pay for a bunch of the electricity to create the attacking box which is what the budget is but you can you get paid a block reward for all of the antenna for all of the Watts that you make and so actually the total cost of the attack after factoring the rewards becomes either 0 or negative so we can look at different consensus algorithm in this way and proof of stake is actually kind of in large part about trying to take this chart and improve on it one important concept in crypto economics is this distinction between and have attributable or equally attributable fall sands of not uniquely attributable holds so I am NOT uniquely attributable fault is a fault where you know that some mistake happened but you have no idea who is responsible right so for example if you have a watch in and you have two different Forks then one of the two sides here is responsible right one of the two sides here builds on top of an old walk instead of building on top of it you work but you don't know which one you don't know whether the top chain came first or or whether the bottom chain came first like some people might know if they're watching the network closely but there's no way of proving who did what first cryptographically and so the fault here is not uniquely attributable and the problem with them uniqua attributable thoughts is that there's a limit to how much you can penalize them because if you penalize not at you've done you attributable faults too much then there's a risk that innocent people will get caught and so you're making the system much less attractive to participate it uniquely attributable faults are faults where if some actor misbehaves it can be unambiguous we should know that it was their fault so if some protocol requires me to show the results of a calculation and someone show excuse to me goes fine then that's something that you can be kind of point to and say look at this guy over here and clearly it's definitely this guy over here could be could be the mistake and published a false statement and you can give them a pretty large protocol penalty so this it kind of gets us to the goals of proof of state right so in front of stake validators have to beat the posits they have to put their youth into a smart contract in order to participate and the reason why those coins have to be walked up is so that if you validators make uniquely attributable faults if the family dinners do wrong things that they that can be identified as specifically exempt doing wrong things that you can have either protocol penalties touch these deposits and take away their the deposits and this is what weeds do an extremely high cost of attacking prove a steak that you just do not get any proof of work system the civil finality and what is finalized basically if the validator is kind of make a series of messages supporting the blog in such a way that in order to also finalize a competing blog the valid at least one-third of elevators would basically have to publicly contradict themselves so the kind of naive way to think about it is for a walk to be finalized two-thirds of people have to vote for it and so for a competing walk to be final is that two-thirds of people will also have to vote for the competing blog and so one-third of validators would have to contradict themselves and if a validator contradicts themselves you didn't take the evidence of data you can use that to penalize them in reality it's more complex than one round of voting and spend about least two rounds of voting using this clever algorithm called Kasparov FG I encourage people to learn more about counts preferred key by reading the paper on archive yay so rip of state is all about encryption we can all make septic or brute before it is all available we can all make septic or there is a lot of other things that are also available groups we did not make scepter for me what an interesting thing is that crypto economics can sometimes compete with cryptography right so for this one is useful example to think about is interactive computation so interactive computation is this kind of scalability primitive that basically is true trying to allow block chains to learn the results of complex facts about computations without actually doing the entire computation on the watching so for example suppose you have some function y equals f of X and it turns out that F it can be decomposed into this format where it's like you start with X then you apply on one then you apply F 2 then you apply a free but Laden appliance 99 to then you apply F 100 and basically you have a small value you go through a series of small values and you get Y at the end so here is a protocol for kind of how the blockchain can learn the result of this computation would now execute an ultimate on chain so you set the problem you said here is f here is X we wants to learn white you have a smart contract that contains some award and the smart contract implements this protocol anyone has the ability to submit a sequence of values basically X 1 X 2 X 3 so all of the intermediate steps of the computation and you can like you can have the individual steps how to equate a bit of computation in them right you just basically each individual step has to be small enough that you can execute an inside of a plot so the proposer submits the sequence of values X 1 X 2 X 3 all the way up to X 100 along with an opossum so this is step one step two you wait right and there's a challenge period so suppose for example that as a kind of as a simple example the the channel of the problem that we're gonna make them watching trying to solve is we're going to try to calculate to ^ town in suppose we live in a universe for multiplying by two is really hard and so we can only multiply by two once inside of a block so how do you do an interactive computation to compute 2 to the power of 10 right basically if you would have to submit all the intermediate mountains right you would submit these 10 intermediate values you would submit 1 2 4 8 16 multiply and you would submit these values and then you would have this challenge period and in the challenge period basically anyone has the ability to do kind of points to one particular value and say wait this value actually isn't 2 times 2 value before so in this case willing suppose we have this kind of evil this guy and the evil smiley face guy is just really really tired of this stupid idea that a kilobyte is a thousand and 24 bytes instead of behaving house of bytes and so this guy wants to solve the problem by convincing the world the to the power of 10 is not a thousand 24 it's actually a thousand and the evil smiley face guy is gonna do this by well submitting these ten values right these are the powers of 2 1 2 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 - and 250 500 1000 they're the powers of 2 each one is placed the other than the thing at the end of the thousand what's the big deal so within this challege period a challenger can say hmm someone has drawn on the watch in I could say 3 will I disagree with that 250 there I think I'm not doing 28 times - it's 256 and the Challenger can submit a transaction that points to this index and when that happens the calculation actually runs on the blockchain if that procedure were multiplication by 2 128 times 2 is run on the blockchain in the watch hands like wait they actually inserts 256 and this guy submitted 250 so this guy's wrong and so the original submitters deposit gets destroyed and part of the deposit is given to the Challenger as a reward so this is a group to the economic protocol right because because the ability of this protocol to work relies on incentives it relies on the penalty that the submitter gets if they submit a set of polygons oh we're one of those thousand and it also relies on this reward and that was that the Challenger can get if the detects that one of these values is wrong and they send a transaction that remember what showed us of watching which meant action is wrong allows it to be verified and allows the submission together gently now this cryptic genomic protocol basically is like in some ways the core of how optimistic roll-up works right so if anyone has seen I'm optimistic roll-up like that if you can make an exchange thing that's been floating around he's playing like this is the kind of fundamental purpose of economic math enough that protocol works on and basically how it allows scalability to happen by just doing computation off chain by default unless someone complains about some particular transaction in some particular block being incorrect so notice that the interactive computation does the same thing as the a snarks right Ziqi snarks are about doing conversation auction making a prove luncheon and allowing everyone else to just verify the proof instead of here running the entire computation themselves interactive computation does the same thing a few people run the computation option in the run descriptive economic interaction protocol and the facts of this cryptic atomic interactive protocol happens in the career on chain and everyone saw this happening it can convince people that the results of the computation is correct too much without them having to run the entire computation themselves and this is kind of the the schism between zk role of versus optimistic role which is better well they have different advantages right so snarks and do not require a challenge period so when the snark you can know the answer immediately whereas with enough m and mystic or interactive computation game you have to run of wheat of course some period of time to make sure that nobody challenged the computation snarks are less efficient so a zero knowledge proof have a very high computational overhead and with general purpose of universal machine execution the overhead goes way higher optimistic computation does not have this problem an interactive computation is also easier to implement and especially for more complicated general purpose applications then you can also look at this optimistic approach so crypto genomics is used in aetherium land for lots of things it protects the base layer of the protocols that we all know and love it protects our life clients it protects the security of our glorious and sacred layer to games plasma channel us optimistic roll up true bit it can be used for thoughts and thoughts resistance such an improved security of option messaging protocols it's so much more so this really is kind of the bedrock of what large parts of our you go system are based on and since we're what by kind of planting the seed in 2009 Satoshi a would have created a really an of interesting and great thing and now we're careful to bring things on top of it thank you
