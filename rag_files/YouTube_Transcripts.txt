    A lot of the time when people talk about some of the challenges with crypto one of the answers that people tend to give is people tend to say you know this is still early days right we're still building we're still building out the basic infrastructure you know look how long something like the internet uh took to came into fruition right and this is something that I think people have been saying since uh like basically almost since Bitcoin itself launched and one of the challenges with saying this of course is that today you know we are not in early days anymore right Bitcoin has existed for 15 years ethereum as a project has existed for more than 10 years and uh you know we see things like Chad GPT rising up from not even existing as companies to suddenly completely changing everyone's understanding of what intelligence even is and so you have to ask the question of like well how do we actually even think about this right are we actually early and the way that I answer this question is I think we are not early to crypto but we are early to crypto actually being usable so let me explain what I mean with uh by going a little bit into history so who here remembers back in 2013 when we were all excited about Bitcoin and uh Bitcoin was the next big thing Bitcoin was the next big revolution for payments and people were making these really amazing and really Earnest efforts to try to just get regular Merchants all around the world to start accepting Bitcoin who here remembers room 77 in Berlin anyone here eight there yeah so the one on the right this is Boston it's a restaurant called thonus monkfish that's actually the first Bitcoin restaurant that I want to so back in 2013 you could be a proud Bitcoin accepted here restaurant and also be a proud LGBT Friendly restaurant at the same time and um you know crypto Twitter would not think that there is any contradiction uh so back at the time there was like real genuine excitement about this so what happened well one way to answer this is uh we can look a little bit further and uh the memory that comes to me is this to Argentina that I made in 2021 so this was my first time in Argentina and the first thing that I noticed was that there was this population Countrywide that was not just incredibly excited about crypto but that was actively using it on a massive scale like literally yeah I was walking around on Christmas Day and the first coffee shop that I noticed was open I walked in the owner knew who I was and the owner let me pay an e for the coffee and some dessert that I had with my friends now they were using crypto but they were not using decentralized technology what they what were they using it turns out the Argentinian locals were all using binance to binance transfers why binance to binance transfers are instant and binance to binance transfers are free and this is ultimately the same problem that I think ended up killing at least the original wave of exploration into getting everyone to adopt Bitcoin as a currency it was the fees if you remember the marketing at the very beginning why Bitcoin is great it talks a lot about how Western Union PayPal credit card companies they all just horribly you on fees they charge like incredibly High fees like they're awful right but then Bitcoin itself the fees went up to $50 um ethereum all the fees went up to the highest ever fee that I paid on uh ether was uh actually for a privacy preserving transaction so admittedly the gas went went up and uh you know basically like big parts of Twitter comment every time I do things so privacy protocols have a really good product Market fit and so the transaction feels about $800 so basically the reason why a lot of this stuff failed is fees what's new in 20124 well this is a chart of fees on ethereum lawyer 2s they have gone down from being somewhere between 10 and 50 cents to being under 1 cent basically zero at the same time optimism and arbitrum two major ethereum Lear ones have hit this important security Milestone that's called stage one and multiple rollups have also told me that they plan to head stage one very soon so rollups are rapidly becoming safer and rollups actually are finally affordable but this is not the only thing that's improved one of the other annoyances that I distinctly remember suffering on my trip to Argentina was uh I tried paying one of these people in eth on layer one the transaction fee was about $4 and the transaction took about 5 minutes to confirm now this was after EAP 1559 had come on chain but this particular wallet it had not actually upgraded to AP1 1559 yet so on bitcoin blocks come every 10 minutes and so you have to wait 10 minutes potentially an hour for transactions to confirm ethereum theoretically the block time is 13 seconds but because of the way that the gas market used to be really inefficient sometimes you'd have to wait a totally random amount if you get unlucky 5 minutes maybe even longer for a transaction to get included ep1 559 actually basically fixed this and if you add on the merge the one of the things that the merge did is it also cut in half the average waiting time until the next block and so with both of those those things actually these days I reliably have my own transactions confirmed in 5 to 15 seconds then if you use layer twos that have fast pre-confirmation often this gets down to 1 second and so basically the two big problems that are this the biggest things that made centralized ux much better than decentralized ux in 2021 today decentralized ux has them too but also we can look at the general us experience quality of applications so on the left here you have ether tweet from 2015 and you know it looked it clearly looks like a hackathon demo now on the right here you can look at Firefly which is a client for forecaster and Twitter and lens and if you look at the quality of the UI like this looks like a web 2 level of quality but it it's a decentralized application under the hood but also this year we saw progress in a account abstract we saw more and more people using safe we saw ZK email E 7702 we're starting to see mainstreaming in ZK sarks all kinds of different applications so we have new and better privacy protocols Railway Oxo uh zoo zoo pass which we'll talk about a bit later raro which can prove that in zero knowledge that you have a passport and then you could do voting on top of that also even existing ease of use improvements between ler 2s two years ago everyone was complaining about having to manually switch networks today I think like for a at least the last year I actually haven't yet manually had to switch networks so before the limitations of the technology were a stopping Factor like I even remember that moment where crypto kitties looked like it might become this really big breakout app but then what happened crypto Kitty own success pushed the ethereum gas price all the way up to 50 gay ethereum became basically unusable and that by itself put a ceiling on the grow this is nor true but this basically means that the reasons not to use crypto are nor here what about the reasons to come in the first place one of the uh mistakes that I think people sometimes make is uh talking about crypto as being an efficiency technology this is something that a lot of people talked about even back in 10 years ago so this is a random page from 2013 that was just listing the benefits of accepting Bitcoin right so P Made Easy um security and control over your money zero or L Fe or low fees protect your identity right so two of the four are I think things are feat that are features that are very unique to crypto the other two well they were unique to crypto then but are they now right today we have venmo we have a much better sea payments there's WeChat pay the centralized systems keep getting better and better but yet in some places payments and access to finance remain durably difficult why do they remain difficult it's not because of access to technology it's uh basically because of limit limitations in global politics so I think it's important to remember right that the kinds of benefits that crypto brings to the world they don't have to do with technological improvements of the same type as switching from a regular jet to a supersonic jet is a technological Improvement it's a type of Technology what kind of type so one way to look at this is uh this blog post that Josh Stark from the ethereum foundation wrote about two years ago and the title here is atoms institutions and blockchains and the thesis is that blockchains allow us to create a kind of digital hardness any kind of social hardness basically that lets us create persistent digital structures that are hard that and that can resist being broken in the same way that you can make hard physical structure out of something like concrete and if you think about how blockchains from some of the previous Cipher pug technologies that they came from things like mixnet things like tour things like bit torrent the thing that you realize is that blockchains are all about creating persistent structures that are extremely robust right so a file sharing Network well if a if your file share Network blows up that's fine you just switch to a different one and after a week everyone forgets if a blockchain blows up and you switch to a different one everyone loses all of their money this is a fundal difference between what technologies before blockchains did and what blockchains do and so blockchains because of this enable the internet to not just Route Around weaknesses in Old World structures but also do an actually better job of uh building better Alternatives that can solve similar kinds of problems so blockchains are digital concrete and digital concrete digital concrete for building digital Castles in the Sky so who here has uh seen this uh this movie a la Castle in the Sky raise your hand if you've seen it raise your hand if you know the opening theme song okay let's do a sing along so this is uh one of the actually so the reason why this movie is fun is I mean first of all I actually think it's like great and I think like studio gibl is absolutely top tier and you could probably tell I've seeing this like five times at least but um it turns out that it was like also somehow accidentally the inspiration for ethereum without us even me even realizing it basically what happened was in 2013 I was browsing a Wikipedia list of fictional elements right and I Came Upon ethereum in that list and in the list I saw okay this looks like a really nice name right and you know it reminds me of this 19th century scientific theory this idea that there's this medium that permeates everything and so okay fine I picked the name then two months later one of the ethereum foundation designers back before it was even called the ethereum foundation uh decided to use this diamond as the ethereum logo I thought okay this is a really cool diamond it's I like the logo it's beautiful years later I watched this movie for the first time and then I saw wait they have etherum crysteum cysts look diamonds and so it turns that a of eum like art was uh inspired by this without even realizing it so and the other thing about that like that song right is that the song like it actually sounds nice right like I think in crypto you know we actually need better songs right it's like you know a lot of the time if you ask someone to like come up with an Anthem for a project like they come up with something that's totally cringe right it's like decentralized We Stand United a hash confirmed a new block invited like okay you know if you like rap then that's good right but uh do you really want that to be your Anthem forever right okay so I mean you know back in 2013 right there was this other song that I remember there there it was uh there was this artist named krya it's Q said and done all your Fe inflate be on the Sun but no more because now there's a better one and its properties perform better than all the rest of them it's mathematical no more double spend it's encrypt put your cash in your brain or it's wearable a new form of wealth begins wait who here actually remembers that one okay I do uh so see it like digital Castles in the Sky I think are the unifying theme that combines the serious and the fun aspects of crypto together this is what I want people to remember a castle is something that can protect you and keep your family and keep your tribe safe a castle can also be a castle in Disneyland that lets your community have fun a castle can also be a museum that preserves all of the entire thousand year history of your culture and a digital Castle similarly can be all of these things and dig and digital castles of all types are something that we can build on on top of ethereum so done with digital castles um what should our key goal be so this is I know my view that I've said the whole time right we need to satisfy the needs of mainstream adoption and we need to hold on to open source and decentralization values at the same time what does this mean so example one W it's right there's two to hold your m one of those you Bally you know you do like the crazy self- sovereignty maximalist thing you write down a seed phrase you do everything offline you take your seed phrase you engrave it on a piece of titanium you put your titanium inside of a lock box that's made out of even more titanium and then you like put that lock box 10 me underground and then your coins are safe right so that's one approach the other approach is to say bro I'm like a normie I'm not going to do all that and so instead you basically go and you take your coins and you go off to give them to some trustworthy guy you know there's this nice guy his name is Sam he goes on panels with Bill Clinton he's got to be trustworthy and uh you know two years later it uh you know it turns out that your assessment of who's trustworthy and who's not was a little bit wrong so I think these are not the only two Alternatives right so basically if you want to be protected against centralized Bad actors then you do the traditional self- custody thing and if you really want you can put it in titanium and put it 10 met underground if you want to be protected from your own mistakes you do a centralized exchange what if you want both this is what smart wallets with multisig let you do multisig means you have multiple keys so you might have for example six keys out of which you need four to send a transaction and you could even have a rule that for small transactions you only need one and those keys can be any combination of keys that you can contrum friends and family ZK rappers of existing services so you could even make a yaik rapper of an email you can literally today make an ethereum account which is a smart contract wallet from which you can only send transactions if you generate a proof that you canoll a particular email address right so you can basically take web 2 uh trust anchors and you can like pull them into the web 3 world and in the web 3 world you can even diversify your trust right so you can ZK w a Gmail account which is a US company then you could combine that to make another one of your Guardians be a ZK rapper of uh you know like an Indian government ID and then you make a third key be a hardware wall wallet that was made by a company in China right like you can maximally diversify everything and so even you can actually get the benefits of institutional trust without a lot of the weaknesses so example 1.5 decentralized social media ux forecaster is a user experience wise warcast as a web2 quality app but you can set your recovery address the thing that has ultimate control over your account to be your multisig and I personally trust my multisig way more than any one of my centralized accounts example two payments so this is a doo it's a wallet that is meant to be entirely ethereum based but it has the same ux quality as venmo example three privacy pools privacy pools uses a mechanism where users can prove that their Depo their withdrawal came from some deposit without revealing which one but revealing that their deposit did not come from one of the bad guys and so this is a way that allows you to have a very high degree of privacy for regular users and meet a lot of uh important compliance needs but without actually having back doors example four ZK social media this is a zoo pole which uses zo pass and so can prove that you're a human prove that you're a member of a community solve proof of personhood problems solve reputation problems while still preserving your privacy it's not about either you're an Anon or no and nobody trusts you or you're KY didn't verify that you have no privacy it's like no you can have privacy and you can have trust at the same time example five ethereum layer one a lot of technological improvements that are happening that make the layer one both more performant in terms of red ring finality time increasing capacity and at the same time more decentralized and easy to verify and a lot of these things are already happening right so this like these are all directions that the ethereum ecosystem and I think crypto in general are going to be going over the next 10 years right we uh basically the two wrong paths are one is to sacrifice practicality for decentralization and forever being an ecosystem that's just appealing to itself and only has 691 users the other bad path is to sacrifice decentralization for practicality and to say okay well we're trying to get Mass adoption and so guess what the next great crypto application you have to log into it with a freaking Gmail account right what do we do best well no you know we do not have to take either of these dark choices we have decentralization and we have practicality at the same time eat both pills be purple take both thank you

    Thanks to the power of modern communication we have the ability to create technologies that are decentralized removing middlemen and allowing users to interact with each other directly through a global network decentralized applications have been becoming more and more important in the past 10 years and have the benefits of massively reducing costs and barriers to entry removing single points of failure preventing censorship and ensuring transparency and trust between all the parties involved in an interaction bittorrent a file sharing network that developed in the early 2000s is arguably the first decentralized application to have been created bitsword allows anyone to share any kind of file with anyone else in the world allowing people to distribute content quickly and easily even if they do not have the resources to pay for their own website or server five years later satoshi nakamoto came up with the idea of a blockchain a sort of distributed database and used it to build bitcoin the world's first decentralized currency decentralized currencies like bitcoin allow people to send money instantly anywhere around the world with no regard for national borders with negligible fees bitcoin is increasingly being used for international remittances micro payments and commerce online decentralized applications for finance cloud computing messaging and distributed governance are soon to come ethereum is a platform that is specifically designed for people to build these kinds of decentralized applications or dapps for short the ethereum client which we are calling the ether browser will include ability in peer-to-peer network for sending messages and a generalized blockchain with a built-in programming language allowing people to use the blockchain for any kind of decentralized application that they want to create ethereum can be used to build financial applications that are fully trustworthy and transparent because they run on the blockchain online cryptographically secure systems for managing your property and contracts social networking and messaging systems that allow users to maintain control of their own data systems for trading underutilized computational resources like CPU time and hard drive space and eventually tools for online voting and distributed governance and the most exciting applications of ethereum are probably the ones that we have not even thought of as with all new platforms for innovation like the protocols that underlie the internet itself it is not always easy to predict what they're going to be used for gmail facebook twitter instagram and the modern internet as a whole are all a result of early developments in the world wide web and javascript the programming language of the world wide web from the 1990s similarly by providing a universal programmable blockchain and packaging it up into a client that anyone can use the ethereum project hopes to do the same for finance peer-to-peer commerce distributed governance and human collaboration as a whole now the question is what will you build on top of ethereum.

    okay so back back when bitcoin was originally created in 2009 Satoshi zu was really testing two things at once so the first part is there's this idea of Bitcoin the decentralized currency it's a form of money that exists purely online and you could transfer it from anyone to anyone in the around the world instantly with pretty much no fees you can transfer money from Kyrgyzstan to Guatemala just as easily just as quickly and just as cheaply as you can to your own neighbor and there as we have seen there are a lot of people interested in that in that innovation Bitcoin form of money has attracted a pool of a ten billion dollars of wealth over the past five years it is being accepted by over 50 thousand merchants worldwide and there we have companies like Bitcoin coinbase that are injured that are trying very hard and I would say succeeding at getting Bitcoin adopted by increasingly large segments of the population and as a rymus said I think we're only getting started but at the same time there's also the other side of Bitcoin which is Bitcoin the blockchain so big Bitcoin the technology is this a global trust free peer decentralized database it's this database that anyone can add things to but no one could but you can't remove anything from and it just so own now it just so happens that currency is this is the first app now these two technologies by necessity have to be married together because in order to have the decentralized database you need to have security in order to have security you need to have incentives and you need to have a currency so so really Satoshi had to take these two concepts which are really quite different and test them both at the same time now this the second side of Bitcoin the Bitcoin blockchain is something that I think has been seeing a bit less attention maybe in the first few years but interest is also picking up so here are some of the first applications of Bitcoin not as a form of money but Bitcoin as a form of distributed consensus so first one is same coin name coin is essentially a distributed DNS system for those who do not know what a DNS system is when you go to google.com how does your computer know which server to talk to so the answer is that there exists this the system which Maps Google the name google.com to the server's IP address so your computer actually first queries this domain name system and it asks hey what server is google.com and the sir and the server answers and that's and that's how your you're able to talk to talk to Google server without having to memorize everyone's IP address second second part escort transactions so we a lot of people here I'm sure I've heard of the concept of multi set of multi-sig so the idea here is that you send money to say three people at once in such a way that you need two of those people to unlock the funds so what are some practical applications of that one practical application might be say consumer protection so for example if you want if I'm a merchant and I'm selling some product to you the consumer the simplest way to do that for it would be for you to just pay me and for me to send the product but what if you don't know me and I'm not necessarily trustworthy so then what you would do is we would both agree on an arbitrator and we would and you would send the money to our two of three multi-sig between yourself myself and the arbitrator I would send the product and then at some point normally you would confirm that you receive the product and the two of us together would release the funds now if one of us disappears or one of us turns out to be dishonest then the arbitrator can step can step in and work with the other person to recover the funds so this is essentially bitcoins also alternative to PayPal chargeback system now then we have this concept of colored coins colored coin the idea behind colored coins I would say saw its first beginnings in 2012 so the idea there is okay you have a blockchain and you have a currency on it but what if you can put other currencies on the blockchain as well so the idea there is this is to say I let's suppose that I am a goal sure I might be countable ammaji metals or some larger company and I and I wants to issue gold on the blockchain so what would I do I would take say ten bitcoins and I would and I would say each one of these bitcoins is also worth 10 ounces of gold and I would say it's each one and that's each one of these specific bitcoins and then you could actually track those specific bitcoins through the blockchain and you can treat them as sort of their own currency living and living inside the Bitcoin system and then if someone at some future point in time returns one of these colored gold coins to me then I will return to them in ten ounces of gold now then so now you have the system where you have lots of different currencies on the Bitcoin blockchain what's the next step well let's have a decentralized exchange between the currencies so as it turns out that this is this is actually somewhat hard to implement so it has to so the research behind it has actually taken some time to develop and we are actually seeing a lot of interesting protocols around that over the last six months now after that there's also some other interesting ideas there's this concept of smart property so the idea there might be what it what if you had or say a museum pass and in the idea there is that you would issue a currency was just where that currency has one unit and if you own that unit then you can use you can use your phone and you can and you can sign a message with the private with the private key that owns that that would old currency token and then that sort of works that works as a museum pass you can use it to get into a museum if you want to if you want to sell the museum pass then you just transfer the coin to someone else and now and now they can sign it with their phone they can get and they can gain access another idea is smart contracts so the idea there is that instead of having contracts that are in four that are enforced by the legal system you have contracts that in section we enforce themselves so one idea here might be a financial contract so suppose that I might want to put one a thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin into this financial contract and then someone some other counterparty would put $1,000 into the financial contract and then what one month later I would get $1,000 worth of Bitcoin back and the idea is what if you can have this contract in force itself so in that in that way I can essentially have a thousand dollars worth of value without without volatility risk on the on the blockchain without having to rely on it on any kind of centralized issuer finally there's this idea of decentralized autonomous organizations so the idea of a Dao or as other terms you might have heard include decentralized autonomous corporations or decentralized autonomous companies decentralized autonomous communities India there is to have either a company an organization perhaps could be a company it could be something like WikiLeaks it could be something like ICANN the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and numbers that sort of which is the organization that actually manages the game IP address allocation and DNS registration and so forth what if you could have these organizations live entirely on the cloud so these organizations would still control resources but those resources would be controlled by us by a smart contract that never expires it just keeps on updating itself so unformed so these are essentially some of the applications and there are thousands more than we haven't even thought of now here's just a some detail about how colored coins works so you would have some issuers acquires that that's some subset of bitcoins have have a certain color and then if you send if you send a transaction where the inputs have a certain color then the outputs have the same color now if the inputs have mixed colors then you might have some special rules applying and then you would just trace the transactions back through the Bitcoin blockchain to determine what color they are so you can see there a simple diagram is that you might have color you might have green coins blue coins and red coins perhaps representing US Dollars gold stocks in a company whatever else and you could simply trace them through the transaction graph and figure and figure out exactly who owns the coins of each color at any given time now another more advanced idea is this concept of a metal coin so the idea behind a metal coin is this is this idea that we should treat metic owns as view which would treat Bitcoin as this low-level protocol like a sort of tcp/ip on the internet and then we should build other protocols on top so this other protocol would use Bitcoin just as a data layer it would put data into the Bitcoin ran into Bitcoin transactions and then you could see there would be a completely separate matter coin protocol that would scan through the transaction to determine what the balances are so what are the advantages pretty theoretically pretty much no limits you could have decentralized exchange you could have savings accounts you could have advanced smart contracts you could have peer to peer Satoshi dice theoretically there's pretty much no limits to what can be done with this kind of paradigm however the problem problem is that there have been there are a lot of we a lot of people think that you can that you can just implement all this stuff on top of Bitcoin but in reality there are actually serious we serious scalability issues to doing so and as I'll explain these scalability issues are actually the reason why people have been so people have been so frustrated trying to implement this stuff a colored coins project has been worked working hard for the pet for the last 18 months and they've been trying to come up with extremely clever color transfer rules and to try and make things more efficient but so the fundamental issue here is this concept of simplified payment verification so in Bitcoin as it turns out you do not need to download the entire blockchain to have a secure of a coin client you can just look for specific transactions and now Bitcoin has this mechanism called a Merkel tree that you can use where you can prove that a certain transaction exists in the Bitcoin blockchain but only download a small part of the data you of the entire data set so the idea there is that you can't Act is that nobody can actually Forge any part of the Merkel tree because the different the differences sort of keep on cascading upwards and eventually there's some kind of inconsistency problem is however if you do if you try now with Bitcoin simplified payment verification is nice and easy lots of when clients use it it's great with colored coins it's actually hard because you have to trace every single transact every single transaction back all the way back through the back through the blockchain and I couldn't you have you might need to do hundreds or thousands of simple high payment verification requests with meta coins it's pretty much impossible every node has to process everything so here is where aetherium comes in so if your so what we've said with the theorem is that yes this idea that we should have HTTP on top of tcp/ip is wonderful that's the way the internet protocol works that's the way every other protocol works that's the way cryptocurrency protocols should work but bitcoin fundamentally was never designed to be a TC a tcp/ip bitcoin was more designs to be an SMTP smtp being the protocol for email it's a protocol that is that is very good at one particular test Bitcoin is very good is very good for transferring money but it was not designed as a foundational layer for other for any kind of protocols to be built on top so aetherium is there for its own blockchain so a theory borrows from ripple this concept that we should separate the state from the transaction list so you do not need to download every single every single transaction that ever happens in order to determine what the current state is and here is the fundamental part it has its own built-in programming language so the idea there is that if you look at a lot of the recent innovation in some of these so-called next-generation coins what someone's I've been saying is okay we want people want people to be able to do the centralized exchange on the blockchain here's a transaction stéphanie centralized exchange we want people to be able to do a peer-to-peer gambling there's a transaction type for that we want people to be able to have savings wallets or the transaction type for that we want people to be able to do escrow there's a transaction type for that so that is that is fundamentally if the wrong way to go about doing things just imagine if your computer actually had 30 Hardware modules you would it would have a hardware module for solitaire a hardware module for internet enter explore a hardware module for chrome hardware module for a for Photoshop that's what that's not the way we do things you know back in 1933 in the 1930s Alan - Alan Turing came up came up with this this concept of Turing complete programming languages where instead of having instead of specializing for each individual application you come up with a programming language and then that programming language is so powerful that you can build any application on top that can conceivably be built this is the reason why computers are so powerful today this is the reason why web browsers are so powerful today once we after we came out with JavaScript around around 2000 you know the internet just blew up the inventors of java scripts never intended for somebody to write gmail on top of javascript or for somebody to write facebook on top of JavaScript or for somebody to write Bitcoin wallets on top of JavaScript but javascript this programming language of the internet browser was a foundation for innovation and that's why 13 years later we are still innovating today and that's what I hope to bring to the world of cryptocurrency so what is a contract so aetherium instead of having lots of features tries to be simple it says if you really we do not have features we have just the programming language so everything that you want to implement through aetherium you would have to implement as a contract so a contract is like this automated agents that lives inside the blockchain and it has a certain amount of and it has some script scripting code built in and it can store it can store ether it can sting can store currents it can store currency units and you activate a contract by sending a transaction to it so the idea is that you can send money into contracts and you can send messages to messages to cut to contracts in order to make to make them carry out certain computations order or perhaps to authorize withdrawals or it's in order to make votes in a decentralized organization or even to make sure answers in an internal currency so out of this one built out of this one building block this is this one single leg of LEGO brick of cryptocurrency you can make pretty much anything soap etherium script is the language this is the current scripting language that we that we have is a language it's somewhat similar to Bitcoin script but it's also more powerful so we have a stack we have some operations we have but the differences with Bitcoin is that we have memory entries and also we have this concept of storage so BIC won't this is the other fundamental limitation of Bitcoin scripting language the kwid scripting language is binary a transaction is either spent or it's not spent that is fundamentally extremely limiting because you cannot have if you look at something like a decentralized organization or a financial contract of any kind of complexity you cannot reduce it to this concept of SS expires it's not expired so here we have contracts can have pretty much an unlimited number of number of states so you could have a contract to be at stage 1 at stage 2 at stage 3 you could have a contract store an entire write an entire balance sheet so right so now how about we'll talk about a few examples of what you can do with the theorem that perhaps might be difficult to do with Bitcoin first of all named coin so here is named coin in five lines of code so what is a so this named coin this is a 60 million dollar million dollar cryptocurrency you can implement the most basic version of name point in five lines of code so this is the contract so the idea here is that for is basically it's using contract storage so the contract look so a transaction it needs to have two data inputs the first data input is what name you want to register and the sec and the second one is what you want to register it with so that second one thing might be an address it might be some kind of might be a public key so then if some if it's already registered then you do nothing although other otherwise you register it and that's all it is so here's another interest the other interesting thing about aetherium is that we can work together with protocols that are not just financial so for example in there's the state there's this idea of bit message bit messages as purely peer-to-peer over open source decentralized replacement for email but one of the huge problems with big messages is usability aspect because in email you could send to some to some nice and easy email like Vitalik and etherial at aetherium zorg now here in a bit message there's no there are no email addresses there are these long 34 character bit message addresses nobody's going to remember a bit message address people don't even want to want to bid message addresses what if you could register a bit message address inside of this namecoin contract with something nice and simple like if it's allocated theorems org and then if somebody wants to send money to me there dear whoa it can just look up my they can enter vitalik at etherium org and their clients can just look up my actual bit message address inside of this namecoin contract create your own currency now creating now a lot of people are saying like we have way too many currencies now why do we have so why do we have so many currencies now I actually think this might this is extremely powerful in a way that not many people realize here's here's the deal in the in the past ten thousand years one of one of the major political dynamics has been this concept of centralization and decentralization we all understand the benefits of the central of decentralized system we all understand the idea the idea of localized markets of individuals acting independently but at the same but at the same time we understand that centralization has it has its benefits like there is and that one particular benefit there is this concept of public goods so there are a lot of things like science like scientific research like prevent like protecting the environment like fighting disease all these applications that are extremely valuable but they're but their value is so is extremely widely distributed so that each individual would only benefit an insect an insignificant amount from each from each particular action Mart pure markets have have no way of paying for this centralized and centralized institutions do simply because they are so large that they can act that they can absorb enough of the benefit for it to be worth it for them for them to do these things so this is why we have large corporations this is why we you this is why we often we have large governments and this is why we have large Don prophets now currencies are actually as a very interesting thing because creating your own current currency is actually Lee for the first time that we have something which is simultaneously decentralized and it can find these public goods you can have a currency such that twenty per say twenty percent of the issuance goes to P goes to people who do mathematical research and then if people want to support mathematical research they can accept the currency that's no caught that doesn't actually cost to them it's not like they're donating they're not losing money but at the same time the more merch the more merchants X the more people accept this currency the currency just naturally gained naturally gains value and people work people working on these on math problems just yet this this extra phantom value out of nowhere you could have currency is funded if that finds medical research you could have you could have currencies that are that try to find environmental applications so the idea here is that one let's not have one currency let's let's have thousands of currencies and we can have this form of this sort of economic democracy through a currency system so aetherium is a platform that makes that makes it a thousand times easier to bootstrap your own decentralized currency because you can just make it as a contract hedging contracts we talked about this a bit I put in one thousand dollars you put in one thousand dollars worth of worth of cryptocurrencies or worth of Bitcoin worth of ether and then a month later I get a thousand dollars back and you get the rest so what's the value proposition for you get this bet you get to speculate in favor of if they're added to X leverage and the value proposition for me is I get secured I get security I don't have to deal with volatility risk so this so we've seen for a lot of applications that are trying to say oh let's help if people want to have US dollars on the blockchain what's having let's have an issuer and that issuer will issue their own currency in that currency can be redeemed for US dollars yes that is one way of doing it but you have to trust an issuer so here's another way of doing it you would you would have a contract that listens to a bloomberg price feed of what the you what the value of ether in u.s. dollars is and then it automatically gives me back a constant value you know a constant value of ether aetherium is internal currency but a constant constant value measured in US dollars so here this is not trust free but this is massively reduced trust because instead of trusting an issuer all you have to trust as a price feed and you can trust like nine out of nine hundred eighteen price feeds if you wants you can do for voting forwards you can do proof of proof of stake voting there are lots of ways that you can mitigate any kind of problems here decentralized autonomous organizations so what if you could have a company who will whose organizational bylaws instead of being enforced in the legal system are enforced literally on the blockchain so the organization might have some capital it might have a millions all words were a million dollars worth of ether but then you would or might even have a million the organ is a this contract might even have a million a million dollars stuck in a in a in a hedging contract so this is the other nice thing about aetherium contracts can use contracts so the idea here is that you will need two-thirds of an organization's member members in order to agree to do anything and that's pretty much the only rule you could even have self-modifying code you could have a rule that says you need you need the support of two-thirds of an organization's members in order to change the rules of the organization sure and some right just know more and more here some other interesting applications savings wallets so we talked about multi signature escrow here are some the etherium potentially offers them massively expanded versions of multisig a score could you withdraw limits crop insurance what is crop insurance you could have a hedging khanjan you could have a financial contract off of the weather peer-to-peer gambling so you can do a peer-to-peer Satoshi dice on the blockchain decentralized exchange data storage decentralized Dropbox you can you can have a decentralized Dropbox implementation that lets anyone participate you will be able to earn money by renting out your hard drive mesh networking computation systems you can use big-big you can expand this idea of name point and turn it into an entire reputation system into a decentralized so into an entire decentralized social network and perhaps maybe even Skynet yes where will the okay so I'll repeat it okay so I'll talk a bit about the about the funding model so we will have a fundraiser for two months starting fabric starting February 1st it will be available at funds etherium org so will be so the idea is that part of the initial issuance will be one thousand for one Bitcoin or up to two thousand ether for one Bitcoin if you get in or way to compensate for the increased risk so the issuance model is that we will fund rate suppose that we hand out X ether through the fundraiser then then there will be about zero point about 0.5 X will be pre mind and then 0.4 X after that will be minds per year forever so it's this hybrid of master core of the master granion triple model and the pure bit the pure Bitcoin mining model and even to a slight extent the info the inflationary model so the answer is in terms of in terms of the portion of the pre mind that has already been allocated that is vested for one year so if any of the if any of the founders though we've leave the project then within the within one year then then or if and then the other founders have the right have the right during the first year to cancel the to cancel their allocation in which case that will simply be this redistributed handed back through the etherium organization as a long-term reserve and then did you on the site one of the second part right so right so the big so at the start the Bitcoin is going is going to be centrally managed we will have will have a transparent accounting system so the big one will go towards development it will go toward heavy security research go toward developing applications toward working with broad projects like bit message and store developing things like things like incubators so we will have models and we all release cell very detailed documents on how we're going to do that over the next few days and eventually we hope to turn the etherium organization itself into a Dao okay I um hold on yeah um I will I will be just uh standing over there outside so if anyone wants to ask questions feel free

  - Video: "Vitalik Buterin"
    hello. okay everyone's listening instantly that's good okay yeah so today i wanted to talk about something that's like different from what i talked about last year but still i'm you know within the range of things that i talk about um often which is just like some thoughts on the longer term future of where ethereum is uh going as a protocol right so here not just to the ecosystem but like you know specifically the blockchain and kind of the core infrastructure around the blockchain the consensus and just what do we expect that that side of things to look 10 years from now and how can we start now to build toward something that actually would be the an ethereum protocol that we actually that we would want to see in the long term um so the ethereum protocol right now is in the middle of this long and complicated transition and it's a transition toward becoming a system which is much more powerful and uh robust in a lot of ways right so at the end of the last year i published this kind of updated roadmap documents where i mean we talked about these kind of big five categories of like stuff that's happening in ethereum protocol lands right where there's the merge the surge the verge um and then a bit lower is going to be the purge and the splurge right so the merge is a proof of stake the surge is shorting um and the verge is verkle trees the purge is like things like state expiry and like deleting old history and the splurge is basically just all of the other fun stuff um so there's a lot to do in each of these categories right so like in the merge for example um you know we uh four choice improvements um actually i think uh this little square should be completely full now test networks uh this this one should be like probably 90 percent full because the only thing left to do is to do a merge on robston which should happen quite soon um and then you know merge and post merge obviously enabling withdrawals so that people who actually just started staking would would actually be able to get their money back but then there's also these like interesting longer term extras that we want to do right so uh single secret leader election basically means that like you make the who is going to be the proposer of the next block more unpredictable and the purpose of this is to like protect against uh dos attacks right so with um ssle you're not going to be able to tell who is going to create the next block until they actually release the block which is really amazing right because that basically it gives us really nice security property where like if you're an attacker and you want to stop blocks from being created you don't know who you have to attack um single swat finality um it used to be called single squad confirmations now we're just calling it single swat finality uh basically moving to a world where ethereum can actually confirm blocks within a single slot uh this is something that i have been kind of looking into and talking about for probably the last like half a year or so there's a lot more work on it happening uh one of our researchers uh francesco has also uh done a lot of work and there's a lot of uh interesting stuff being done by consent as researchers on trying to figure out the best way to do this but it's like actually more possible than it seems which is uh interesting and then better signature aggregation that's actually kind of part of facing us what finality right so there's a lot of stuff to do and proof of stake the end state of all this will be a proof-of-stake mechanism which is really great but in order to get there there's like all of this so work that needs to be done uh the surge sharding right so this is um basically yeah i think uh before we wanted to do four four eight eight uh we decided that we would like to rearrange the numbers a bit so instead we're doing four eight four four um which is uh proto-dink charting uh basically trying to kind of lay the groundwork for doing full sharding kind of have all of the data formats in place um and also at the same time adding like at least a little bit more data space that rollups can use to make rollups much cheaper right potentially some you know could even be something like 10 times cheaper uh so that would that's like the prototyping charting then after that we want to do ding sharding and which adds a data availability sampling um and then we want to do like other things uh around just increa increasing the amount of space that we have some kind of like fast uh faster confirmation so that ethereum could have not not just greater scalability but also like lower latency and at least until you get some degree of confirmation that your transaction got included so just a lot of like interesting things at the end of which ethereum will be a far more scalable system ethereum today can process about 15 to 20 transactions a second and this ethereum including the roll-ups including the sharding um if at least according to the math it's able to going to be able to process 100 000 transactions a second um and you know hopefully there's going to be a lot a lot of other benefits that come at the same time right the verge uh stateless clients so you will be able to verify ethereum blocks and even be a validator without having hundreds of gigabytes on your disk uh which is so great for decentralization the purge uh so trying to actually cut down the amount of space you have to have on your hard drive trying to simplify the ethereum protocol over time and not requiring nodes to store history and then just like this big long list of things right so there's this big long list of like really fun stuff that will make ethereum into a much more powerful system a much more robust system a much more secure system and even a more decentralized system but it's a long and complicated transition there's a lot of stuff that's happening like each one of these boxes uh basically like all has like some kind of team associated with it at this point uh so no a lot of work that needs to be done right um so the difference between bitcoin and ethereum is uh that uh bitcoiners consider bitcoin to be eighty percent complete and it's here but ethereums consider ethereum to be 40 complete right this is like i think actually something that i've said a couple of times before and you know when you look at what ethereum is trying to accomplish and you know it's true right like the ethereum protocol is like really trying to still trying to fulfill this role of being some kind of secure base lawyer but trying to do so in such a way that like it actually has the functionality that it needs to be to be a secure a secure base lawyer for the stuff that people actually wants to do right and that does involve adding more features it does involve doing more work um and uh but you know at this um at the same time kind of there you know there is also still this kind of this end goal but you know we're a bit further away from getting there um i'd say it's 50 ethereum it can go up to being 55 percent complete after the merge uh so uh we're getting close um you know we i think we're getting close to kind of the second half of um this uh kind of big long vision right which is uh really amazing and like you know all of the people that have been uh working hard to make it happen should be super happy at this point um so completing the transition involves deep changes right it involves deep changes and i don't just mean like deep changes that people who write code have to care about i mean deep changes in how people think about the ethereum protocol and kind of conceive of the properties that the ethereum protocol provides people who interact with ethereum uh so monetary policy right so the switch from proof of work to proof of stake is gonna decrease issuance from five million a year to this kind of weird math equation that's like 166 multiplied by the square root of the total deposits so if there's a million if staking it's 166 000 if there's a hundred million he's taking it only goes up to 1.66 million so in all cases it decreases by a lot right it's not fixed anymore but it's much lower than it used to be so monetary policy is changing security model is uh changing so proof of stake is it is much more secure than proof of work but it does have its trade-offs and this concept of weak subjectivity is one of the big tradeoffs of proof of stake and you know this is something that i've talked about a lot this is something that we've talked about a lot this is something that ethereum researchers have already built a lot of tools around measuring but it is a change to the security model data availability sampling so this is the idea that you can literally have a blockchain run without needing even a single node to process the entire chain which is something that like from a blockchain point of view is very fascinating and mind-blowing but from a kind of broader distributed systems point of view it's like totally uh common sense right like nobody would even consider building a version of bittorrent where everyone has to download every movie right but that's how blockchains work today uh so trying to kind of combine the actual distribution uh like of that you see in peer-to-peer networks where you actually have like different parts of the network responsible for different parts of the data with the uh security properties and blockchains provide right like this is basically what um ethereum is trying to go towards and that does include some change some changes to the security model layer 2 history access so a lot of dapps that are built on ethereum historically they've relied on this assumption that you can use things like history access that and you can look at historical logs you can look at historical transactions and the dap from like you directly using the web3 protocol would be able to just like tell you the entire history of everything related to you that happened in the dab right and this is something that has been true for ethereum's history but it's something that's not going to be true anymore and the reason why it's not going to be true anymore is because of eip4444 right basically with the ip444 moving moving toward a world where this function of accessing and restoring and retrieving all of the entire history of ethereum is not going to be a kind of core requirement of an ethereum node anymore right and the reason why it has to be done is basically because people value scalability and if we want scalability um and if you want decentralization so like the ability to run nodes easily then you just can't require nodes to store this kind of constant ever-growing amount of space now there are alternatives right so there are plenty of like very secure very decentralized ways to store the history that do not involve requiring every single ethereum node to store the history um so there's like second layer protocols things like the graph there's work that's being done by people in the portal network there's a work that's being done by some other groups there's people trying to kind of upload a part ethereum history it's a bit torrent there's block explorers of which there's like a bunch and you can probably make a multiplexer that just like keeps on asking each one of them and you can even make a protocol that like asks them for proofs to make it more secure um so there's lots of alternative ways to access history but that's not going to be like something that the ethereum protocol itself is directly responsible for right so that's a change to also a change to the security model now it is a change that i think dapps have already mostly adapted to like if you use dapps today most in the access history most of them don't you are not going to use like the web 3 api directly lots of them already use the graph right so this is something that i think the ecosystem is already adapted to but it is a change that is a kind of unnecessary part of ethereum becoming more decentralized and more scalable um new cryptography so the ethereum of 2015 relied only on ketchup hashes and elliptic curve cryptography for security right just those two ingredients the ethereum of uh 2023 is going to rely on that plus more complex uses of elliptic curves with things like uh with things like vertical trees if they come in 2023 it could be 2024 as well um also elliptic curve pairings which is a more complicated form below the curve math which the beacon chain already relies on um some like universal trusted set up for data availability sampling um and you know potentially like some eventually the randomness is going to be augmented by vdf as well right so there's also like some new cryptographic assumptions that are being introduced and these new cryptographic assumptions give us a lot of really massive benefits right so like the ethereum of today that uses bls signatures that rely on pairings that allows us to have hundreds of thousands of validators which allows us to have a led people stake if they directly with a minimum of 32 if does anyone remember what that minimum was before we decided to use bls it was 1500 right so we added a security assumption and or on a new cryptography and the benefit is that staking became 50 times more accessible so basically there are very real benefits that are going on but also the real changes here um the transaction inclusion process so eip 1559 happened last year it was amazing it changed a lot but it also changed a lot about how we have to think about including transactions account abstraction uh basically people being able to send transactions that are verified not just by elliptic curve signatures but by like whatever kind of algorithm they want so like so you could have better multisigs better smart contract wallets better social recovery wallets move to other algorithms um potentially um with account abstraction you could also have signatures that are much smaller you can use a signature aggregation and this is really powerful in roll-ups because uh so here the erc4337 team this is the team that's uh working with the working on the account abstraction of eoc right now they've been starting to do this and with a signature aggregation you'll basically be able to remove the 65 bytes from every transaction that are the signature and replace it with just 65 bytes for an entire block right um so potentially roll ups could be could become three times cheaper if this is all implemented right so a lot of like inch b uh proposer builder separation could also change how transaction inclusion works right so there's a lot of things that are happening and a lot of things that have big and important benefits but that also require kind of changing how we think about certain things right and it's also involved building a much stronger and a much more capable research and development ecosystem that's capable of coming up with these changes testing them making sure that they're that they actually do what they need to do implementing them implementing them across five clients making sure they're implemented the same way across five clients making sure there's no bugs and doing that entire pipeline and actually getting them to production right so there's a lot of stuff happening but and um this is where it gets to kind of the more cautionary part of the talk that doesn't mean that we should keep going this way forever okay so basically i think um so this is this is i think both my preference and also my impression of something that a lot of people want for the ethereum protocol which is basically for the a desire that for ethereum to kind of eventually settle down right so right now i think we're entering into this kind of period of rapid change where the capabilities of ethereum are increasing rapidly right so you know we got eip 1559 we're going to get a switch to proof of stake we're going to get vertical trees we're going to get single secret leader election um and we're going to get evm improvements and all of that all of this are really cool stuff but at some point the rate of change of the aer protocol is going to have to again slow down right and uh like basically it does it doesn't necessarily mean that that kind of ethereum ossifies completely but it does mean that it does kind of look somewhat like more like a system that optimizes for safety and predictability and less like an ecosystem that optimizes for impressing and dazzling people so why settle down um by the way these are um qr code links to kind of articles where i talk about some of these things in more detail but uh one reason is the layer separation vision right so this philosophy that layer one is for security and dependability layer two is for rapid iteration action high scalability extremely fast response times like good features for users and all of these different things right and the theory is that we can get the basically the benefits of both at the same time and the way that we do that is we have this underlying safe and secure l1 that focuses on safety and security and that focuses a kind of uh on not on a kind of out maneuvering ever kind of everyone else and not on kind of doing everything else as quickly as possible but on surviving and um you know on surviving much much longer than like things like things like luna do right um so the layer one you know really needs to optimize for being safe and layer two can optimize for like actually doing really amazing and impressive stuff um and all your two has been doing amazing and impressive stuff right like there have been all of these azik evm announcements that we saw over the last couple of days um there's a lot of work that's being done um you know by yeah both the optimistic and the zk teams like um optimism has um added uh compression um arbitrary has been kind of quietly yeah uh progressing and just uh you know becoming more stable and adding features um you know starknet has been recently made their role their uh kind of announcements um and uh we we're starting to see more and more i don't know what kind of a network starting is going to shape up into being and there was just a lot of amazing work that was done on cairo there minor zika sync um is going forward and uh you know polygon zika roll up uh so you know scroll this kind of big long list of of uh teams uh that has been just doing all this amazing work um and [Music] that like really has been kind of rapidly iterating and um acting um so the reason i think behind this idea is the functionality escape velocity thesis right so the functionality escape velocity thesis that basically says once l1 is strong enough the rest can be done by the way too right so this kind of vision of simple boring slow l1 but and like fast action l2 is a good vision but it requires l1 to be good enough to actually support it right it's kind of simple similar to what's our incompleteness where if you have a computer that's powerful enough then it's powerful enough that you can build basically anything on it but if the computer isn't powerful enough then like very quickly it turns into a machine that can do almost nothing right like in terms of what you theoretically can do on a computer from 2020 and say 1990 the difference isn't too large right it's just a difference of like what's the level of like scale that you can um and the level of performance that you can achieve but if you look at the difference between an early computer and say a pocket calculator well the difference is fundamental right it's like no matter how many billions of years you have with a pocket calculator you can't make it run minecraft with a you know computer from 1990 you can right and basically the functionality escape velocity thesis says that there's something very similar like this for blockchains where blockchains have to provide this basic set of ingredients uh so enough data for roll-ups rich statelessness so you can do a kind of logic around logic around like things like either snarks or fraud proofs um just some kind of basic censorship resistance functionality i'm just having an asset like this kind of fairly basic list of things um that ethereum already provides a lot of but it doesn't quite yet provide 100 of and that big long list of features that we're looking at adding in is in some ways about kind of filling that in right and also developers need a break new features need time to de-risk and i'm like basically again you know once you start working less hard on kind of making features go up you can actually start working harder on doing other things that are very meaningful in other ways so one of the trade-offs in doing this well is uh there's this trade-off that ethereum has of uh complexity of the change that's being made versus the complexity of the final result right and this is one of these kind of very subtle points where basically there are a lot of opportunities that are kind of short-term pain and long-term gain so what do i mean by this um banning self-destruct right so this is uh one of the kind of things that i've been pushing for a long time it's one thing that i think a lot of the core developers have been pushing for a long time basically the self-destruct top code is just one not actually that useful and two it's uniquely bad in terms of like how much complexity it adds to the evm and two implementations of the evm and to the difficulty of making other kinds of changes to ethereum and so if we just remove that opcode that's actually a very significant uh gain in simplicity but it it does come at the cost of breaking backwards compatibility for a few a very small number of applications um reforming how gas costs gas costs work around child calls around memory just like the way that gas works today is in some ways needlessly clunky in a lot of cases it's both too complicated and too kind of overfitting to uh very specific situations um eap4444 so this is requiring no longer requiring ethereum clients to store the entire history evm improvements so the evm object format eip is that try to like allow you to add other sections to an evm code a switch to vertical trees and a and what comes with a switch to vertical trees is some other changes to how gas rules work right so there's a a lot of these opportunities that add functionality and that even increase the simplicity of ethereum right so ethereum after you go through with all of this actually becomes a system where like the number of lines of code you need to have in a client and even in the spec actually decreases over time right which is amazing but in order to actually have all of these benefits like you know you have to go through a short-term pain now what do we mean by short-term pain one is that the features have to be implemented right another thing that i mean is that there are a couple of like applications that are designed in just like ways that are uniquely unfriendly to some of these changes and those applications will just have to change how they work right now this is of course something that should only be done with a kind of very long lead time right so to make sure that everyone who's going to be affected by it is aware of it everyone who is uh has an application that like really depends on exactly how things work now has the opportunity to change to something else but once it's done and this is an opportunity to do something where there is this kind of pain that happens once but then there basically future generations will be very thankful that uh you know there aren't these kind of annoyances that have that people have to keep on coding around and think and uh thinking about forever um so the ideal long-term goal here is basically that kind of the total complexity of ethereum so not the same thing as the level of capability right so the level of capability goes up but the level of complexity like we're here we're still adding complexity but i have this hope that the level of complexity at some point can even start to go down right now why can it why would it go down because of some of these simplifications also because ethereum clients would not necessarily have to keep on supporting very old versions of the ethereum protocol um after the merge you could even build an ethereum client that just completely does not know that the proof of work phase ever happened which is like a huge uh simplifying factor in a lot of ways right so there's um a lot of ways in which complexity of the system can go down over time um so in the short term some of this does mean breaking backwards compatibility in a few very very limited cases right it's like really a very small number of cases and like like one of my claims here is that like that is okay right that is like basically yeah you do need like at some point an ecosystem does have to be willing to do this kind of short-term pain and long-term gain gain trade-offs but an ecosystem also should not be in this kind of mode of like changing things rapidly forever right so short term still in rapid change mode but longer term at some point you do need to kind of have this pivot to a in an ecosystem where change is less rapid even more consensus on everything is required than today things do keep moving even slowly and that does look very different from the from the way that ethereum works now uh so things in particular that like i would be scared of doing right so things that i think we should not do one is uh adding support for multiple vms so simultaneously support evm and ewasm and cairo and other stuff the reason why you don't want to do that is because that just multiplies consensus complexity like getting rid of the evm is too hard and so if we add stuff well we're going to have like three different vms and the number of lines of code in the protocol is just going to you know keep on blowing up forever right um getting comfortable with base layer snarks before we have much better circuit legibility right so before we really have the tools to kind of dig into zika snark circuits and like be able to properly understand like here's exactly what's going on at you know each individual constraint right so basically like my opinion right now is that starks are still a bit a bit too black boxy and um you know hopefully they're going to become less and less black boxy over time which is something that's uh that would be really amazing uh but i like i personally do think that something like that is a prerequisite right we want to make snarks more understandable before we make the ethereum base layer itself actually depend on them um also i'm like i personally am scared of surrendering to this idea that like it's okay if no single person can understand the ethereum protocol because we can specialize like i think part of ethereum being a trustless protocol should actually be ethereum being a simple enough protocol that if you really wanted to wrap your head around the entire thing you should be able to right and like that is in in some ways very kind of constraining and that does be imply a layer one that uh you know has less kind of dazzling bells and whistles and less functionality in a lot of ways but in my opinion i think if the goal is to create a layer one that's kind of maximally robust and maximally dependable this is something that i'm gonna like i would say is worth it so what are other like awesome things that you could that i think that we should actually increase our focus on over time right so these are things that i think we need to start working on today and we have started working on today but things that we're like basically once the level of effort involved in increasing capability starts decreasing the level of effort involved in making all this other stuff happen can start actually going up right so one of them is like an easy to use light client for the ethereum consensus layer and the execution layer and layer twos and for such a thing to be a default right so like basically i want to see a world where instead of the default like instead of a a new ethereum user by default using metamask that plugs into infira i want them to you or would like to see a world where they can use some wallet that actually is a light client that directly uses decentralized protocols to plug straight into the the ethereum network right and for that to happen both for base ethereum and for layer twos so also for um you know starch net and optimism and decay sync and arbitrary and scroll and all of these and polygons as well to um also kind of somehow plug into the system and so you can actually directly have light clients that can act they can access and directly verify all these systems better support for homestakers and better support for like smaller scale decentralized taking polls right so even for people who need uh staking like um staking pools because they don't have 32 ether they don't have like whatever the level of ethos that's going to be required still better give them better ability to like join a smaller scale pool that doesn't involve joining one of the big ones also the ability to run a full node on lighter hardware i think this is something that especially once we have more zk snarks can easily improve over time right like so once we have stateless clients with vertical trees it'll improve a lot because you're not going to need like 500 gigabytes of hard disk space anymore right like post vertical trees it should be possible with a well-designed client to just run everything entirely in ram right like it should not actually require that many that many gigabytes now potentially being a validator might require storing other stuff and it might kind of go up a little bit beyond that but hopefully not too much um you know like i personally still want like mobile phones taking to be eventually possible um so like basically how far can we go on like making the entire ethereum ecosystem like actually meaningfully decentralized meaningfully reduce dependencies on kind of like single actors meaningfully reduce privacy risks that come from dependence on single actors um and just actually make the the ethereum network kind of resilient in the way that i think a lot of people want it to be uh so pursuing decentralization goals is harder today because the protocol changes quickly because the total complexity is getting higher but in a protocol that is simpler and a protocol that is slower changing i think pursuing more decentralization is actually something that does become easier so i do think that there are changes that are worth making in the long term right so like i personally am not predicting that the ethereum network is going to act like ever be like become something that undergoes literally zero change um and like there are here's some examples that are i think are actually worth it um upgrades from quantum resistance quantum computers there's a big chance that they're eventually going to come and once quantum computers come we have to upgrade to different cryptography right so can't use elliptic curves can't use pairings can use hashes can you starks can you use lattices right uh can he use either genius so that um basically once quantum computers come we are going to have to kind of get used to using different tools which is uh obviously something that the ecosystem will have to learn its way around it is something that involves some sacrifices but it's something that just has to be done if you want ethereum to be secure um if zkvms work well increasing transaction space in the base lawyer so if once you know we have good circuit legibility and we have a very good zka implementations that can snark verify the evm then that's something that could be applied in the base layer you could start adding more transaction space you can start using more data space to or more of this data availability space to add transaction space um so things could be done there um if much better cryptography comes out that lets us massively improve efficiency and simplicity we should use it right so today i'm advocating and a lot of people have been advocating for ethereum to switch from hex merkle patricia trees to vertical trees maybe in the future um ha like just hashes and arithmetically friendly hashes are going to be de-risked enough and are going to be friendly enough that we're going to want to actually give up on vocal trees and do stark proofs of uh arithmetic friendly merkel trees instead if that happens then like i think we should do it um and also i think we should keep an open mind right and like we don't know what the needs of 2032 are going in demand um so one example of this is like the whole mev uh situation right like in the kind of the centrality of mev as this issue that the ethereum protocol needs to like really build and work around that's something that we weren't really aware of back in 2019 and we became aware of in 2021 and now it's like well understood and it's part of like how we think about the ethereum protocol in 2022 right so there could be other things like that in the future like you know we might have to think in some different way about you know how to deal with 51 attack so you might have to think about like adding other kinds of of features to ensure a staking decentralization right like there are more things that could happen there are always unknown unknowns um but at the same time like that number of unknown unknowns is something that i do think should uh decrease over time right uh so basically the challenge here is uh you know how do we balance all of these different demands like i think in the short term we are in this kind of environment where it's just unavoidable that all of these rapid changes that are going to produce all of these really important things that ethereum people have been looking forward to for a long time are going to have to be done right like people have been looking forward to proof of stake for a long time who here wants to cancel proof of stake i saw one person tried to raise their hand and then lower it for fear of getting cancelled um no no please if you want to cancel if you want to cancel proof of stake we're not going to cancel you or just uh you know there there are plenty of blockchains like there is uh ethereum classic which is you know the original ethereum which did not betray the vision by forking the dow it's a very welcoming community and i yeah you know i think they'll definitely welcome proof of work fans um so it's not even a joke like if you like proof of work you should go use ethereum classic it's a totally fine chain um but but anyway um so you know proof of stake lots of like it's a big change but lots of benefits um sharding right so anyone here want to cancel sharding okay now let's see not too many okay i see a couple of hands that raised a little bit more confidently right but i think like you know in general like i do think that charting is popular because people do realize that like in order to fulfill the ethereum vision we want we actually want to have a much lower transaction fees and we actually want to be able to support you know 50 000 transactions a second somehow and um you know if it's not done in a way that's decentralized it's going to be done in a way that's centralized right so shorting's important right so there is this but there is this balance right of like what needs to be done and um you know what kinds of things can we just leave to layer two and so in the short term um you know there's all of this kind of stuff that i do think needs to be done but in the longer term there is also this challenge of like shifting down the gears again and like actually yeah also settling into this new this and you are normal of ethereum actually being this kind of dependable system that at some point is only going to change very infrequently um and you know that's uh going to be a transition i expect it's you know going to happen at some point but you know what that's going to look like we'll see um and i think it's this is also something that that i know all of the different parts of the ethereum community really need to kind of pay attention to and you know it's uh kind of can like being part of kind of figuring out what this longer term ethereum will look like that's uh something it's not even just for core developers um it's also like there's lots of things that people just anywhere out there in the ecosystem can do to contribute to this there's lots of things that just people out there in the community even people out there in the application layer can do to kind of contribute to this right uh so um you know make sure that uh your application continues to work and even works better um in a world where the ethereum protocol is uh kind of upgraded in a bunch of ways um and uh at the same time um you know also the layer two teams right like if layer one is going to slow down its rate of change at some point then like uh to the extent the change is still required the layer two protocols are going to have to pick up the mantle and you know i think our layer two ecosystem is great and that's going to keep becoming even greater so thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes hello um apparently there's questions so to quiet everyone down the rest of my private key is eight four f uh c two six one nine okay questions go ahead okay i'm very interested in life yours also bound tokens and this is a very fascinating ideas and we i mean the blockchain-based system are public so if we want to make it so a private show i read your paper in my hand now so i mean the decentralized id may be of the best solutions or do you have any uh perspective regarding decentralized id to help build the implementations of private so thank you yeah i mean i think my general view on that topic is like i don't think that i think now is way too early to be debating between like specific packages of solutions right i think like there's a lot of people that have this mindset that like soul bound tokens represents like a particular category of like ways of doing things and decentralized identity represents like a particular category of ways of doing things and i think it's just like way too early to like have that kind of thought because i think we're still in the process of figuring out like exactly when do we need negative reputation um exactly what kinds of attestations do we need like you know what how does it gonna interact with community recovery and like this big long list of things right uh so i think uh like my personal view is that we should have an open mind we should design our identity and like reputation systems around actual applications so like i do not trust anything that would come out if i came out of a committee of web 3 academics like sitting in a room somewhere what i would trust is uh something that comes out of like talking to the pope people and asking like how do we make pope more useful right and um or how do we turn pope into something that can actually serve like the our community's particular need to um say yeah you know give out tickets to defcon in a more fair way or like have one or have like five one token per person airdrops right so like start with applications build the system around the application so to let it kind of more organically drop go from there and at some point it's going to standardize and we need more kind of formalization but i think that time is kind of not quite there yet so yeah i have a question also about the sbts because as you said it's based on reputation and we've seen this kind of case with three hours capital where their uh power to borrow and you talk a lot about the under collateralized loans as well where it was based on reputation was based because they uh obtained this uh trust from centralized actors but we've we've seen also that the only loans that were repaid were the decentralized loans for example or something else so by making these loans under collateralized it could be a danger to the protocols as well if we're using speeches in this kind of case so what are your thoughts on this yeah i mean i agree like i think in some ways like loans are one of the more dangerous and kind of even like longer term use cases of this stuff right because uh like so one of the like one of the philosophical challenges with like this concept of blockchain loans right is like in the blockchain community we value these ideas of censorship resistance and not excluding people right but if you want to have under like if you want to have under collateralized loans then under collateralized loans are based on trust and so and if they're based on trust then whoever is doing the trusting is going to have to like use some kind of mechanism to figure out like who who are they actually willing to trust and that requires knowing deep information about people that requires like excluding people and so like really threading the needle between like how do you even do that and at the same time how do you do like not do the bad kinds of exclusion like that intuitively to me that seems like a hard problem right like i do think that there are improvements that we can make but it's like something that we can only probably work toward over time so like for me that like applications of soulbound tokens that excite me are like one i think token airdrops should be like many more of them should be per person or they should be like some square root approach right like the reason you might want to do a square root is if you want to like if you actually want to support like people who have like greater levels of dedication right so you know if you want to do something where like you give someone an airdrop based on you know the square root of like the amount of activity that they've done in some ecosystem like that's both more kind of egalitarian and widely distributed and also um you know actually a good distribu good distribution but that requires like some kind of sold-out token ecosystem to be able to do well and do kind of in a way that's like credible and where third parties can be convinced that you did it fairly uh so start with those kinds of applications bootstrap the ecosystem um you know have like more popes for stuff have more reputation ecosystems um you know have um and just like keep building that ecosystem up more and more and like once it's powerful enough then we'll start to see loans kind of pop up right like but i don't think that you know starting with under collateralized loans is necessarily the right order for things thank you

    so today I am going to be talking about rabbits no rabbits are outside of D5 but I'm going to be talking about other things that are outside of D5 and rabbits um so the vision for ethereum and for I think a lot of the crypto space even Beyond ethereum has always been going Beyond Finance right it's always been about taking these ideas of decentralization and Trust minimization experimenting with building and implementing using many different kinds of mechanisms to areas that go far beyond just a finance right so this was a post that I wrote even back in 2013 this was uh this part of this three-part series and Bitcoin magazines or the Bitcoin magazine article on a decentralized autonomous corporations and the one example there for a decentralized autonomous Corporation this was back before they were called organizations that would actually be useful was this thing that I called identity Corp and it turns out that what this thing is trying to do is basically exactly the same thing as proof of community and it like Works in actually not that difference away from proof of humanity I mean so this was ideas that I've had in 2013 other people have also had been having similar ideas for a long a long period of time so doing like interesting things like this that go beyond just um you know giving people tokens and letting people earn yield on their tokens and tokenizing the yield and entering yield on the on the yield tokens this is a like going Beyond stat has always been like part of the vision and I think for a lot of people even the most interesting part of the vision of general purpose blockchains but today you know we mostly just have Finance right like there's a lot of excitement around defy and there was you know the summer of D5 and uniswap has been very successful yay and compound and synthetics and Ave and the various projects that will get super upset at me for not mentioning them um have all been very successful um see I mentioned you with a universal qualifier you can't complain um so there's definitely this perception that Financial applications uh dominate the ethereum space right um so to clarify right like this is not bad right and you know DFI people are great I mean a D5 dad is great too um but um the chip but this isn't all that um ethereum was trying to do and uh the question is well you know why is uh is finance so dominant and to me like there have always been two primary reasons one of the reasons is that Finance is just the area where centralized technology sucks the most right like I can send you a centralized email and you will get it within one second and like sure maybe various intelligence agencies I'll read it but like at least you could read it and at least you can read it one second from now International Bank wires do not work that way right and you know they're still a notorious way annoying and inefficient and there is a lot of these extra frictions that still persist in the financial system and so the decentralized space just is a bigger Delta from centralized Finance than it was than it is from um centralized other things but at the same time centralized other things do also have problems and I think as we've been seeing centralized other things grow more and more we start to realize more and more what those problems are um and also I think there's the second reason which is that so far transaction fees have been high right like when it costs uh 5.22 cents to do anything the dhns can pay for it the Apes can pay for it the orangutans can pay for it um but you know ens names well okay I mean domain names cost eight dollars so maybe you can pay for it but if we start talking about like decentralized social media things where every tweet becomes an nft then like that can't work when you have 5.22 transaction fees um so the good news is that that problem is a problem which is now being solved right we have the Roll-Ups um you know yay optimism um see we got five of them right um and I'm sure once again and all the others that I have not mentioned um but so scaling is being fixed right and also shorting to kind of increase the scalability of that even further um so the basically now actually is a good time to start thinking about well you know can we go beyond finance and start actually building um all of these Apple all of these other things that we wanted to build um the currents focus on finance is interesting because it it does I think end up kind of a confusing people to some extent um this was a an interesting article that I saw this was a a post I think it was something like remaking positive some worlds and it was a a reply to some of the writings by myself and by some other people um talking about public goods funding and one of the uh an interesting sentences in this that I mentioned is um the at the end of the first paragraph I'm saying uh colloquially these Market Primitives are sometimes described as public infrastructure but if blockchains serve a public today it is primarily one of decentralized Finance fundamentally these token holders share only one object object of concern price now that said that's really confused me right because to me like the purpose of these projects is not price the purpose of these projects is utility price is nice but price should only ever come as a consequence of utility um but at the same time you know in the Topsy crazy doggy world of today you know price does end up dominating in people's minds and this is and so you do get these kinds of kind of Impressions that are misconceptions and like severe misconceptions from the point of view of my ideal world but they are again still like reasonable I guess inferences to make if you just look at you know what people are doing today right like so the challenge is well you know I think these kinds of problems are going to just become less uh it will become more obvious how they're not problems once we have a crypto space where there actually is more utility and more projects and ecosystems that are ecosystems that are building all sorts of various different kinds of utility um but we have to actually get there so ethereum being defined by Defy is better than ethereum being defined by you nothing but it's time to go further but where do we go so I think the goals that we're looking at right is so there's a lot of things that people wants to do but it's also important to kind of think through you know what are some of the things that are both valuable potentially and that might be interesting to focus on in the very near term um and I think the two goals that we have to meet like one is alignment with values so it must be something that people in the community at least enough people in the community to build a thing can actually get behind doing and alignment with needs it needs to be something that is useful for people to do um so what do we have so here's what we have already right we have nfts so this year has been like a year of nfts it's you know there's been a lot of these nfts there's been all sorts of celebrities um launching nfts or at least talking about nfts um there's like what you've I mean I'm sure there's a long list I mean I don't know I was going to say Kim Kardashian but she just but she was pumping ethereum Max at Miami so I think we should just cancel her um foreign on board with canceling Kim Kardashian for the ethereum max sting okay um perfect um cancel Floyd Floyd Mayweather too he also wore the ethereum max shirt Okay so but still you know nfts are interesting they're this interesting cultural phenomenon and they really have attracted a different kind of people to the ethereum space that are interested more in the art side than in the finance side right um yes I talk a lot about ens and I think ens is actually a pretty amazing application and it's an amazing application for some fascinating reasons right like it's it is an identifier that you can have that that you control it's an identifier that is like yours and it isn't controlled by you know the like Twitter or Google or Facebook and it's an identifier that can work across different applications like if I'm or you know you can use that to send me if um then you can use that to talk to me on status well you can use that to interact with me in other applications right so we have these kind of identifiers that are useful across many applications and they do not have a yes A Central controller and their identifiers that people actually wants to use right like an email is also a multi-platform identifier but nobody is like enthusiastic about using um you know vitalik gmail.com as their name like Yay Gmail Pride that does not exist for some reason but the reason why you can say what we have already is just nfts the nfts are so amazing is because technically ens names are nfts um but hopefully we'll have more more interesting types of nfts in the future as well so what else can we have right so here's one interesting category that I personally care about um building out the ethereum social media ecosystem so why social media right like why is social media like such an interesting thing to focus on look first of all I'm not the only one saying this right like right preceding me there was uh you know those lovely uh clear Rose presentation and talking about like using the decentralized chord to do moderation um there was like study was um I think announced that he was interested in like building some kind of ethereum based Twitter so other people are also thinking this right but you know like why like what's interesting about crypto social media um so first of all there's a widespread belief that existing social media platforms suck and that we need better ones and this is true for different reasons um so one is uh centralized and arbitrary censorship and manipulation I don't have to explain that one hopefully low quality of discourse also don't have to explain that one and of course like the concept of Engagement and the kinds of Engagement that are favored are very misaligned with quality um so I need better social media too right so this is a a use case that I can perceive as being important very personally right so here's me sending one of my tweets recently where I attempt to explain vertical trees that I'm just linking to my blog post talking about vertical trees and the replies herb dollar T cyber when the bridge between Doja at HTE when anyone know mini Shiva token this is 100 morning oh sorry morning okay um is that like does that mean it did ozone enter your head yeah did I translate correctly no I actuated sorry Michaels I'm not um capitalized pancakes are always the best for breakfast um okay no real like so another example of this right so a retroactive public goods funding um is an ethrock poll something in Turkish unfortunately my yet turkey I I know basically zero Turkish um at all um oh when will we see one eat equals 10K um by the end of 2021 who here thinks that we'll see what if this 10K by the end of 2021. well so plot twist this guy this um this guy is from Taiwan and Taiwan dollars are 30 times cheaper than US dollars so you guys all just said that Heath will be down to 300 US Dollars by the end of 2021. no no I I just made that up um another example why sharding is great demystifying the technical properties if I request ethereum um picture of some guy is that like Neo or Morpheus or like the the sub Jumanji guy I I forget that's great but what is optimism coming sort out your coin mate Harmony is over one check it out okay guys Harmony dollar one remember this is a very a very important coin someone tweeted about it in response to me you guys have to check it out so basically like even I personally would really love to see a social media platform that just allows higher quality engagement period um so you know if someone could solve that then you know that would be amazing uh so why social media right so cryptotech is uh I think actually well suited to solve a lot of these problems so credible neutrality in what is one of the things that I think a lot of people want out of social media and blockchains are good at building a credibly neutral mechanisms censorship resistance blockchains are censorship resistance the concept of shared open state that you can have platforms where content is either Unchained or if it can't be Unchained for scaling reasons it it can be a kind of floating or floating around peer-to-peer networks some things like whisper or waku um and then you have this oh this public open State and then you have these kind of different views going into that state um so you can have architectures that are less monolithic you can have more separation between different layers and like there's an opportunity to build more and interesting things if you do it that way um built-in economic layer so crypto has a built-in economic layer you know you have coins and you can make your own coins and here to do a mechanism design right so it's like there's a natural fit um examples of like crypto social media that are not ethereum and that are not ghost towns exist um I don't approve I don't fully approve of like the economics of everything on here but you know like these things are not ghost towns right like bitcloud not a ghost town like steam high voice if you go on them like you know they're not ghost towns uh so there's like there is evidence at least in my view of this existing demand for some kind of a decentralized social media thing so directions to explore um decentralized content and separating out the contents from different views that can be views on the same content that filter it um prediction market like mechanisms um so the stuff that queeros talked about is like to some extent of alien in that direction but there can be lots of different spins on it right I think the core principle of like introducing prediction market like things is to encourage posts that look good one year from now and not just today um who here has um who remem made a coronavirus take one year ago that they're not proud of today who here has seen someone else making a coronavirus take one year ago they're not proud of today okay there we go see so like uh you know other we know what the problem is the problem like the problem is other people but uh like the the con the concept of uh lasting qual you know encouraging things that actually have long-term value and that aren't just like let's like spin it out so it goes viral and we get some engagement and it turns out it's like it's actually total junk like trying to move beyond that well maybe there are mechanisms that can do that um civil resistance um so you know if we don't want a system dominated by spam then you want simple resistance you want to make it difficult to create an unlimited number of accounts an interesting direction is community focused so forums that are less about trying to create Like This Global water cooler where that tries to like pretends that everyone is two meters away from each other um but more like things that may that allow people to more easily form communities and even kind of enforce rules and enforce limits within their communities even just forums where you can only speak if you prove that you're part of some Dow or you prove that you're part of some community that you have you know could be some number of coins it could be a pope you know it could be a could be some other kind of membership token um like these are like crypto is an ecosystem and we have a very easy ability to do these kinds of things plug-in so this is um another thing that I personally have cared a lot about recently so this is the idea that like you should be able to use your ethereum wallet to sign into things right like we have signed in with Google we have sign in with Twitter why not sign in with ethereum there are projects that are actually starting to do this and there's even like recently we have been trying to promote an effort to standardize this and make it and make it easier to do um and the reason why I think this is valuable once again a few reasons right so first of all today is centralized login providers like are in my opinion worst of Both Worlds in terms of centralization and decentralization so you have a centralized Corp that owns your identity they can see everything you have no privacy you have the risk of arbitrary de-platforming but at the same time like why do you need centralization well if you screw up then maybe the big centralized Daddy can help you well it turns out that like from my first hand and second-hand experience actually talking to Big centralized daddies the big centralized daddies are often too lazy to actually help you right like if you lose your accounts in a lot of these services like often it's extremely hard to actually get it back so um ethereum accounts that are social recovery wallets potentially can out-compete the centralized providers and the decentralized providers on both fronts right so you have both better self-sovereignty and better recovery um the concept of self-custody public key authentication and self-custody public key encryption it's been a dream since the 1990s right like we always wanted you know everyone could have their own pgp key and we can encrypt things to each other but this has been very hard to actually get adopted in practice right so we even needed ethereum to get cryptographic keys into enough people's hands um allow with with blockchains uh specifically we can get uh you can switch your keys you can repoints an ens name you can do social recovery you can do smart contract wallets you can do multi-six and of course you know we have this standard for a wallet that by which anyone can have their key and that you can actually plug it and use the wallet right like if lots of people have metamask lots of people have the status well that lots of people have all these you know all the various other wallets so there we have a standard of some kind so um ethereum login you know One login for many services it's also a username one other reason why using things like a Google login and Twitter login is nice for web developers is that they provide anti-civil protection it's difficult to just create thousands of fake accounts and you know if you get banned for spam create thousands more fake accounts right because you know they do some kind of some level of you know of antisable protection and make it harder for you to create lots of accounts ethereum also does that right so in ethereum you know there is economic civil protection um there is proof of humanity there is Pope there's you know once again this entire ecosystem of tools that exist for this purpose and we can use them and also ethereum login is a natural stepping stone to an ethereum social space um once again there's an RFP with the ethereum foundation and the ens team if anyone wants to help um please check it out um building the attestation ecosystem so this is another one of these things it's not so much an application in the sense of like one app that one person builds but it's like a category of application right this is just the idea that you can have these attestations you can have people just sign a message that says I believe X about accounts Y and you can just publish that and whoever owns accounts why can actually have that at the station it doesn't always it doesn't have to be published on chain if you want to preserve privacy but they can have that information and then if they want to prove it to someone else then you know you can zero knowledge prove it and this is the sort of thing that has been a dream for a long time right but we actually have this growing ecosystem of things that are moving in the direction of being able to do that right once again there's proof of humanity there's the pope there's uh various projects doing like thank you for your participation type nfts open certs in Singapore is like actually running various ethereum Enterprise projects like a lot of projects in the ethereum Enterprise ecosystem are ultimately about making attestations about individuals making adaptations about events providing like receipts for events that happened and so we have this ecosystem of just things that are happening that are cryptographically signed that are cryptographically provable and look we can have more right and we can build more infrastructure to actually you know make all of these things be provable on chain um well voting should not be provable and chain but that's for reasons that I already talked about in other places so I won't get into that now if you want and you should be able to attest to things and use your knowledge proofs for privacy at the same time right so you can make a proof that says like prove that it that I have reputation score of at least 100 according to this metric and prove that I am a unique account but do not prove anything or do not reveal any other information right zero knowledge proofs their magic you can do this sort of thing so like this is an ecosystem that actually can be built can be built out more um git coin is kind of is interesting right in how like they are experimenting with these attestations and not giving you higher trust bonuses if you have like I guess higher levels of verification but like this can be done in a more cross-platform you know like not centralized and more privacy preserving way as well so that's one set of ideas another set of ideas that I personally am excited about is retroactive public goods funding um so I Know Carl talked about it yesterday but I like the topic so I'm going to talk about it again um so once again yay you know new forms of public goods funding um so what is retroactive public goods funding right so basically the idea here is we yes is this concept that instead of funding projects like or having some kind of centralized mechanism that funds projects based on what it thinks is going to be promising we have an ecosystem that funds projects that were already successful and then you basically create the equivalent of a prediction Market where people can fund those projects in advance based on a prediction that what some project succeeds it will get the retroactive Grant so the idea would be that we set up a dow in the the blog post from yesterday and we call it was called the results Oracle and the Dow just judges what projects were valuable according to what community schools and it judges after the facts right so you might say um you know we can judge right now that EIP 1559 is valuable or maybe we want to judge that a month from now we can judge that well your two protocols were valuable we can judge that you know unit swap was valuable and we can make these kind of retrospective judgments and then there's this concept of projects tokens where if you have a project then you can launch a projects token and you can use for this projects token to basically get either get funding for the project ahead of time or you can just allocate that project's token to people who have made contributions to that project and that encourages upfront contribution and then if that token trades on the market then like whoever actually whoever buys up that token or whoever does work to get that token will be rewarded in the future if their prediction about this project being important turns out to be correct right so this is basically like as I think like Carl Linda Jinx I am yesterday it said creating the equivalent of how the startup ecosystem Works where you have Investments backed by the possibility of an it but for public goods so the goal here is to encourage work and funding on things that I call entrepreneurial public goods right entrepreneurial public goods are public goods so projects that benefit a large and unselective group of people so you can't like pick and choose you know you get it you get it you get it you don't get it you get it you don't get it it just you know you it's either out there and it benefits everyone or it's not out there and it benefits no one but at the same time projects that are only seen as important after they are built so entrepreneurial public goods are hard because markets and governments both tends to system systemically fail at them right so markets fail at entrepreneurial public goods for the same reason markets fail at every other public good there's the Fremont rider problem and governments fail at entrepreneurial public goods because being institutions they're either to if they're centralized they're too exclusionary and if they're decentralized they're too conformist right so there isn't a really a good kind of funding channel for people people to kind of get rewarded for building things that are not recognized as important at the beginning but only become recognized as important once the whole the whole project is already done and everyone can already see the benefit so examples in ethereum EIP 1559 so EAP 1559 it's launching two weeks from now yay right now the idea for EIP 1559 was originally came about in I think it was like 2017 or 2018. right so the idea was published then what happened the community just kind of sat on it for a year a few people recognized that it's important but no one was working on it and because and no one thought that they felt empowered to work on it and no one felt that they would be rewarded for working on it and so people sat on it and then eventually a bit more research was done later then people sat on it more then eventually um you know there was some more research done and then finally the community kind of staged this mask protest where they basically just flooded one of the gay coin grounds and they just redirected like half of an entire Bitcoin matching pool over to an EIP 1559 Grant and by then you know there actually was this big Community signal that EAP 1559 is really really valuable and we need to actually do it but it took a long time right you know imagine a world where you work on EIP 1559 had actually started even if by some small team a year just somewhere in the ecosystem that really believed in it one year earlier um Layer Two scaling um so Layer Two scaling right now it's a big space but two years ago it was a small space right and you know even before that like there were teams like for example the optimism team before they were plasma group and when they were plasma group like people theoretically knew that layer 2 scaling was good but no one really felt the urgency and you know some some people did donate a couple hundred thousand dollars to them but you know we're not going now the uh OMG team uh supported them right some a couple of other people supported them but like there wasn't really that much more support right there wasn't really that much kind of incentive actually encouraging them to start thinking about and start working on those problems then now imagine if plasma group instead of being like three to five people had been able to scale up to 10 to 20 people way back in 2018. they would have figured out that plasma is a dead end a year or later they would have probably switched to optimistic Roll-Ups a year earlier and we probably would be Asia you know we would have been selling tickets for efcc on a fully functional and stable optimistic roll-up even right now easy to easy tools another good example um you know stake just infrastructure to make staking easier for users is something that we're increasingly recognizing is really important but that there wasn't really a good proactive effort for it um uniswap right launched in 2018 nobody cared about it for a long time then in 2020 um you know all the the talking heads on uh you know on Twitter that consider themselves to be very smart started talking about oh it's a summer of D5 now and oh amms are the future this story has a bit of a happy ending because uniswap managed to convince Paradigm and that they had some hope of having a business model and eventually they actually did have a business model but this is not the average story right like the there's plenty of public goods that never have a chance of actually getting a business model when they're just stuck being pure public goods um so why retro funding right basically I think the core idea here is that decentralized decision making is much better at retrospective decisions than it is at prospective decisions right like if you just take like a sort of a vote of 100 people and you ask them well what are important things that were done in the last 50 years they might give some wrong answers they might give some crazy answers but you know they could give relatively reasonable answers now if you ask a random group of 100 people what are things that will be important for the next 50 years you're probably going to get total junk right so the idea here is to basically use decentralized decision making retrospectively and allow the people to start and just individually participate in and even speculate on projects prospectively and so those two mechanisms they kind of function according to different principles right like there is both this decentralized community driven retroactive evaluation but then also a retro funding ecosystem preserves a role for leadership it preserves a role for individual Vision Vision it preserves a role for small teams that are just the that are just really sure and they have a really good idea about what is going to be important gives them space to actually build out their vision and if they're if they're lucky actually get a reward and it it creates a reward for making uh predictions about what the future will need correctly so I think the core principle here right and I think this is one of these kind of principles that I think a lot of the crypto space is sort of behind without realizing that it's behind is the idea that like we can be pro-social without being conformist right like the usual divide is you know we talk about individualism versus collectivism and individualism gets criticized as being like less pro-social and being like a like encouraging people to be competitive against each other and fight these kind of Wars of everyone against each other collectivism gets criticized as just being this you know boring gray conformist thing that's just like stepping on your boot forever but what if you can you could be pro-social but at the same time like you don't like there are different ways to be pro-social and you can be pro-social in a way that's different from the way that everyone else is pro-social you can even be pro-social in a way that other people don't recognize is pro-social until it's actually until what you've done is actually done um so I think retroactive public goods funding is like one of those ideas that kind of exists in that top right quadrant right uh so that's I think uh one of so this is also one of the reasons why I think retroactive public goods funding is interesting um quadratic funding I think also falls in there right because with quadratic funding you can the point is to funds public goods but it still leaves open the room for different subgroups of the population to have different ideas about what is what is uh the public good um so you know the one question you might ask is well are there more interesting ideas in that top right corner so retroactive public goods funding is already happening I'm so I think two days ago this was uh quietly announced um the EIP 1559 supporter and Patron nft so uh the there's a group that made an nft and it's going to be sold and all proceeds well I mean you can read the the the screenshot yourself right yeah I I managed to actually screenshot the video at the exact time that it stopped at this phrase um yeah all proceeds go to those Comedia AP 1559 happen um so this is also an interesting experiment and like rewarding um EIP 1559 contributors retroactively um and also the experiment in retroactive public goods funding from the uh from the optimism team um so there I'm sure there are plenty of things that look I would say deserve retroactive rewards today um one other interesting example ZK snarks right that this is technology that we really depend on and there are a lot of very smart people like even the starkware team and um Ellie Benson and his team is one example there's also just plenty of academics in all sorts of places that worked very hard and in some cases even worked for decades to get all of the different pieces of technology that are needed to make ZK snarks possible happen today right and there's this like very long chain of citations right to have us to be able to use a CK snark like you know you need you might want to use polunk and Planck was built by the Aztec team and Planck is based on polynomial commitments and there's kcg commitments that were created by Kate zafarucha and Goldberg work and then those are built on elliptic curves and elliptic curves are created by these other academics from 30 years ago and then zero knowledge proofs themselves or this theory created by theoretical cryptography that slowly grew over the last 30 years and then you have the people who invented the PCP theorem back in the 1980s and 1990s right look there's all of these people doing War all of this amazing work that we now recognize is just absolutely key to making a the next step of this multi-hundred billion dollar industry possible but you know in a sane World there would be there would be a reward for putting Decades of your life into things that become that become uh you know finally valuable so a lot of promise for retroactive public goods funding as well um I think it's an idea that's interesting for the crypto space because the crypto space has a lot of public goods and because the crypto space is just cares about mechanism design experimentation so let's uh let's funds more richer let's fund more public goods and let's fund it retroactively and like Yay you know we can like create like create the public God of public goods um so key takeaways right so the ethereum ecosystem has to expand Beyond like just making tokens that help with trading other tokens right because they're like like in some ways like if you just take like just this narrow thing that is defying you just like to keep you know pushing it to infinity and you keep letting like you know the a16z and the z32w and like the AK-47 and whatever these funds are and they just like keep like you keep going forever and then like you're just gonna get like tokens that give you profit from yield farming other currencies that are Financial derivatives between other yield farming tokens and this other thing that's a prediction Market of yield farming tokens on top of stable coins and like some these things are valuable up to you know layer one and Layer Two but once he gets to layer three it's like yeah and then once he gets away you're sick so like you're actually increasing the chance the the financial instability and the risk of this whole thing is going to collapse and like potentially get a couple Regulators angry right so let's not just do D5 um and doing not just a Defy is uh yeah um yeah it's uh it's already happening right but we can do more so moving beyond DFI is not about being against E5 right so I actually think the best applications the most interesting ethereum applications are going to combine elements of finance and non-finance one simple example like ens ens it has like it has fixed fees and for fixed fees to be possible in a decentralized way you need you know either a stable coin or a price Oracle ens itself like registering domains um it requires money and that's a currency currencies are the simplest form of defy um if we want some kind of decentralized content moderation Dao that might need incentives and those incentives might require a token of some kind right so applications that combine elements of Finance but Finance not just as an engine itself but as a tool to make the non-finance and to make the ultimate utility happen I think applications like that are the future um so what can we do right so turning accounts and like ethereum accounts into fully fledged profiles so I mentioned the attestation ecosystem ethereum logins ethereum social at the same time also um do like actually keep working on you know social recovery wallets and multi-sig wallets and better security Technologies so that you know you're not going to lose your entire ethereum like or online identity if your house burns down in your 20 and the 24 words don't survive um talking not just about D5 but also about D gov um you know quadratic funding quadratic voting I saw the git coin Dow use quadratic voting which I think is amazing um the Retro funding you know are there going to be other ideas um I think this is one of those things that's really worth thinking about so there's a lot of things that we can do right and well let's let's start building let's like do more experiments and uh you know maybe a few years from now and we'll have a lot of just really exciting things to talk about that are providing just all kinds of like very diverse and real value to all kinds of people not just within the ethereum ecosystem but you know also going far beyond it as well thank you [Laughter] of course yeah thank you for for this great presentation uh so when you talk about the retroactive Public Funding like how do you set basically the price at the beginning do you see that more like an As an X prize equivalent or something like that how do you think about it I mean I think like extra index price is a good example but I think the important thing that this mechanism has to provide is that the prices have to be ongoing and they have to be persistent so that people can start new projects in new areas on the assumption that if they succeed then they then they will get a prize in the future right like the X prizes or and like existing prices they tends to be oriented around a very specific goal which I think is good and I think it's valuable but I also like I my what I want to see is also like the for the market or like people people's independent decision making to be not just for like what is the way to solve a specific problem but also for like what are the problems that need to be solved in the first place right so like if you come up with something that people don't even realize is valuable today and then it becomes valuable five years from now like you should be able to get a prize from that and so like I think you know the existing kind of work and thought going into prices is definitely like a good start but I want to take that further as well and then in terms of like what mechanism will decide how the prices are distributed and I think that's kind of deliberately left a little bit blank because I think doing like so if we a perfect solution to that problem would be a perfect solution to the governance problem and Community is very far from perfect solutions to the governance problem right so we do have to I think kind of be humble and realistic about it and approach that problem more experimentally and iteratively um so start with something simple see how it goes and then just keep improving it over time as we see how it actually collides with the real world hmm hi vitalik hi I was thinking maybe instead of canceling Kim Kardashian we offer her like something that maybe she could um join the community for instance she has a closet full of clothing I know there's some fashionistas in here I was hanging out with them last night um and I know vinay Gupta is working on materem maybe uh tokenizing her closet for instance and then adding value to clothing so we recognize it in terms of a theory like its value in tokens instead of um because this is very valuable to women especially where I'm from Texas it's like our clothes are very valuable so it's instead of canceling her maybe we invite her in offering her different um that would be great too um I think the one Province though is that like I really want these nft things to benefit not just the celebrities themselves but also find some way to benefit wider Society too so you know if it like no no if she makes an uh if she makes an nft and a large portion of uh let's say for example some portion of the rewards go to charity and this ends up funding some you know really awesome thing that like empowers poor people and you know in like say yeah the Selfies as you're Africa then like I think that would be amazing and I would be the first to like give some kind of official on canceling um so no no if things like that can happen then uh that would be really delightful thank you um yourself um Heights OH um um after this zika roll up we're going to to be implemented and um yeah and some others several steps will go through and this ethereum level will become the level It Is wishable by all of us I think will it not be the problem by the governance so somehow take the control over because like I've heard the today's presentation about human recognition and by just along we think and yes it is a private blockchain and plus the recognition without naming a name but if you take some other database and basically come things put things together and everything what's going to happen maybe a privacy issue and right then so I think like a couple of things there right like one I think it would be better if these things are done like on public chains instead of on private chains just so that they can be used by everyone instead of just a small group of people and then for a privacy issue like I think private Chain versus public change should not matter because a well-designed system of attestations should not be putting personally identifiable information on chain at best it should be putting hashes of pro of privately identifiable information on chain and if you wants to prove it to someone else that you have something that matches a hash with a zero knowledge proof you can but if you don't send someone that proof then look they're not going to see what the hash represents it's just a random number right so I think like it is definitely important to design these systems privately and one of the reasons why I would want the ethereum community to be kind of actively involved and do it designing these systems well is because if they're not designed well then like someone else with some with very limited technical understanding in a very narrow mind profit motive is going to design them badly and that would be a you know unfortunate now the next of course challenge is like you know if these systems have decentralized governance of some kinds then like what if that governance gets corrupted somehow that is a genuine concern and like I'm worried about this stuff even today right like I'm worried about how even a lot of these like defy governance tokens you know there's like five or ten people that can have that can control half the supply and then they can just like make a proposal and like to make force the projects to do what they want like it's uh I think hardening these systems so that they are more resistance to attack and so that like potentially even like putting a speed limit on them and like designing them in such a way that changes can only happen slowly adding more kinds of safeguards adding more diverse sets of stakeholders like these are all things that we need to also focus and think about more so science scientific research is a good use case of public good that could be funded with the Retro funding and and for example you could give value backwards to uh impact factor of Publications and other microcontributions like peer reviews data collection that usually are not valued economically but so I wanted to know your thoughts about it but also how do you think this could be integrated with the a prospective funding since the problem of science actually to have money to start with projects now I think scientific research is a great example um actually one very timely example of this is like take covid vaccines right like coveted vaccines I think have provided like literally trillions of dollars of value to humanity even right now by just allowing um but allowing us to get past the whole covert thing much more quickly and if you look at the amount of money that governments are putting into them it's like tiny right it was like a few billion here a few billion there it was like it felt as though people were just like stuck in kind of like a standard procedure followed the rules mode and they didn't realize you know the enormity of just like how big a benefit could come of this and like the needs to just actually throw out all stops and put everything into it right so this is look that would be one example where I think like the people who were responsible and just putting in that hard work to make the whole vaccine thing happen like they should be very uh well rewarded for something that like we very clearly recognize today right that um you know if that did not exist then I mean like billions of people's lives would be would be significantly worse for an entire year and I think many other kinds of science are definitely similar medical research in particular right like good medical research has the potential to improve a lot of people's lives um I mean this is also important for me personally because I'm a longevity and anti-aging person and I think like I really believe that with the Right medical research we could be seeing like people just regularly live well past the century by within 40 years and that's these are the sorts of things that could like provide a really huge amount of value but right now there really isn't anything encouraging the people doing all of the kind of hard work like five steps on Upstream of the good outcomes right so I think that's important another thing that's also I think interesting in like in academic spaces is that in academic spaces there's often this kind of web of contributions right so like I'm less familiar with biomedicine but in cryptography as I mentioned right like ZK snarks depend on the code they depend on elliptic curve pairings they depend on kcg commitments that depends on up to curve parent carings that depends on elliptic curves they depend on arithmetization it depends on the PCP theorem and there's this like big graph of important stuff that was done 20 to 30 years ago and that like figuring out how to actually kind of extract that graph like I mean there is a citation graph in Academia which is actually nice right but like trying to kind of make that model stronger and more robust and extend into other places and I think I think there's really interesting problems hmm hey vitalik hello over here yes anyway other side oh yeah just uh just to let you know because your talk had a lot of um uh points about attestations and we just launched the uh well we announced the ethereum attestation service today and it's it's a public good it's uh open protocol it's a registry for anyone who wants to make any attestations on uh on the blockchain uh the the attestations the schemas can also be uh made made there and there's a schema registry so a lot of the things that you spoke about um could potentially use it it's free it's open to use um there's no token or profit motive so take a look at it uh that's uh amazing I mean I think my my advice would be to kind of work with the community and see if like you can get you know the existing attestations like the you know the proof of humanities and the popes and like actually yeah like just get everything together into a framework yeah that would be awesome the time.

  - Video: "Keynote Speech Vitalik Buterin at Devcon5 Osaka - Japan"
    so I wanted to we're going to start this presentation with any kind of simpler question which is just what did situated that's anyway right so who here uh sort of a point through here is aware of the fact that Satoshi created Bitcoin okay so some she created big one right but what makes Bitcoin interesting now the way that you might hear a lot of people describing it is that Satoshi is the first person who solved this long aversive 25 year old computer science problem called the Byzantine generals problem right you didn't hear you did find a bunch of people saying things like this that the solution to the visit his generals problem was invented developed by a man group I'm open bracket I didn't yet know the course dragnet who goes by the name solution Nakamoto the Byzantine generals problem was called unsolvable and so Satoshi sidestepped it many authors have written about the decay of Western civilization and held a loss of power causes society as the disintegrate and Satoshi fixes this problem currently so this is not true the visit the generals problem will solve by I'm a wonderful fellow named SS really important to you and then a 1982 so in the paper that introduced the visiting generals problem he basically provide an algorithms for how a set of parties that all once we agree on something the zombie sadena so I'm gonna buy a choice between some of us up large choices and do so and can interior cemetery easily even under assuming up to a third of them are malicious and even assuming like no assumptions about network synchrony and all of these things right so there's a bunch of different solutions to the innocent in general sub problem indeed visiting generals problem paper and I encourage people to read it so if visiting generals problem was solved at the very beginning and if there were a whole bunch of ways of doing T centralized consensus for 25 years before Bitcoin and 50 years before proof of work started to be used for anything then what did Satoshi really invent since every state events in Complete Genomics so what is curve to economic story curves of economics is basically you know use of economic census to provide guarantees about applications so your kid if you can encrypt aletan Allah makes us being and if the use of upended economics and game theoretic reasoning as a kind of appendage to cryptographic reasoning I mean so cryptographic reasoning allows me to and if believe certain things conditional and some assumptions that basically claim that the adversary must not have a computer that's bigger than the size of the observable universe and that's all really nice but crypto economics allows you to have other kinds of guarantees that cryptography can't provide but because of the types of guarantee is that purposely we can you know make sure is trying to provide there they're not cryptographic guarantees in standard guarantee is conditional on certain kinds of economic assumptions so for example the assumption that apply for will continue running the liveness a also known as censorship resistance is something that can be provided by economics cannot be provided by photography even the assumption that Anakin to decentralized consensus festival come to consensus it is something that cannot be guaranteed by cryptography it can only be guaranteed by some kind of model that says things about the motivations of participants in the what the platform so what chains are crypto economic protocols here's a watch in you have watch and five of those walks are in one chain one of those blocks in a kind of off to the side in the wrong chain and in watching he wants to encourage more miners to create blocks that extend the correct change and you do not want to people to create blocks that just go off to the side to the side and make a different chain and confuse people so how do we do this with economic incentives now it's actually a bit more subtle than just talking about incentives right Bitcoin uses group to economics to solve two problems well the first problem is what I call the witness an assignment problem but you might also have heard about basically the same problem under the name civil resistance so here's the problem right we've had these eft algorithms for a long time these algorithms that say you can get together 15 nodes have them send a bunch of messages to each other and as long as less than five of them are malicious then the system is going to come to consensus and if you can make assumptions about the maximum amount of time that messages can will take to pass between these nodes that instead of tolerating up to for malicious you can tolerate up to seven malicious and that's like even better many of those it turns out that if you didn't allow even stronger like really strong security assumptions you didn't tolerate all the way up to 13 vehicle issues but that's a topic for another day so we've had these algorithms for a long time right and so we have these centralized consensus what's the problem what what has a mistake you know and the reason is ultimately in that even in a system that has say 15 different parties you have to have some mechanism for choosing who these 15 parties are right you could say oh it's like the 15 big major eggs who's here trusts at least 11 of the top 15 major banks it could be 15 of the top world governments were here trust the least 11 of the top 50 world's so this is this is a challenge right if he wants to create a system that actually will be accepted by large constituencies around the around the world then it's hard to kind of create this set of 50 of 15 people that like everyone will agree if they go actually we can trust at least a lot of it's hard to come up with a set of actors running the system that actually is kind of credible mutual right and this is the problem that roof of work and proof of stake so cleverly solved right basically what we report in front of Steve do as they say well instead of pre-selecting 15 people that will run the system we're but we're going to kind of de facto do is we're going to say anyone who publishes a certificate that kind of cryptographically who proves that they've keep and I computed some large amounts of mathematical work gets to join the set so if you can stall like some extremely complicated mathematical problem and you publish a solution to this problem said I you're part of the set a river of stake if you have a bunch of coins and you send the risk points to the deposit contract that I am part of the set and so instead of the kind of pre selecting 50 people that everyone trusts we create this headed open provisional system where anyone can join and participate but then we we the participants by the number of economic resources that they contributed brancelet proof-of-work the they're kind of the weight of the impacts that you have on the consensus is proportional to the amount of computing power that you're bringing to the table and a group of stake is proportional to the number of coins and both of those things take a lot of economic resources to get the reason we can't just allow everyone to join and give them one vote is because well on the internet nobody know he's here a dog and on the internet nobody knows you're a virtual machine inside of my computer with ten thousand virtual machines where that computer's run is run fight a dog look this is the problem that we're sure that we're trying to solve right so economics actually does like do a very good job of solving this problem the kind of creating this set of actors and this kind of set of assignments of voting power to basically an open provisional a set of actors that actually is very economically difficult to take over and become 51% of so this is what for the word solve so this is basically the innovation that made big would possible the innovation that makes theory impossible and proof of stake is a new fundamentally in the exact same spirit except instead of burning a bunch of electricity to to prove that if you have economic resources you're just like waits to be audited the address for your deposit at some point since your question so this is the first problem and the second problem is an incentive problem right you have a bunch of provision less actors and some of them might be wonderful people and some of them might might be people in some country that can bind really cheaply that you have in you have like no don't really understand what their psychology is some of them look like the big big corporations some of them might might be hobbyists some some of them might be like hackers Nicky and I have gain access to computing resources and like these are at of disparate groups of people and we can know look I know very little about what motivates them well what's the thing that motivates a lot of people economic incentives right like we know that people and all these disparate regions like money and wants to gain more it's generally people that don't like money and want to get more are not going to be the ones that have eaten up into the economic resources to make up 51% of the network in the first place so we can kind of use economic incentives as a way of driving another driving this wide disparate group of participants to participate in the network in good ways instead of participating in the network in bad ways so these are both kind of crazy use of the use cases of krypton we cannot make Sandler use that Nick wonder use in aetherium to houston basically you know every major public wants it so incentives pretty queer if you make them walk that's part of the main chain you get a reward and you have to pay some electricity costs to make them walk but the reward is going to be a bit bigger than the cost and if you make a walk that's not part of the main chain you have to pay a cost and so if you're making blocks you have an incentive to kind of continue to extend the chain with everyone else who's here understands this yay so group do we do not makes is great because cryptography lets us prove things with very minimal assumptions about behavior actually without assumptions about behavior terms of economics allows us to prove things with minimal assumptions about participants so the sub an assumption that like they're motivated by economic incentives and actually system skin Evensen works even if people are not willing to I'm just motivated by economic incentives all you need to assume is just an upper bound on like basically how much money attachments have that they're willing to burn and both of these assumptions are pretty ideal for decentralized and transmitted by systems so what are the security goals that we have in terms of economic assessment right so first of all we want the correct execution of the protocol to be a robust equilibrium so you have Nash equilibriums that basically say if everyone is following the protocol it should be in each individual participants interests also follow the protocol well we need something that's even more robust we wants the incentive to follow the protocol - needs to be pretty substantial and we want the equilibrium is to survive even as some sort of a significant percentage of the participants start doing nasty things seeking to acknowledge the kind of games that are perturbed by third parties like attackers making bribes and also ideal way to just maximize the cost of a successful attack so if a successful attack happens then someone who cool cause the attacks haven't wasted a lot of money there's different security models that you can have so for example you can have different kinds of assumptions about participants you can assume participants are honest you can assume that they're rational but they're not coordinated so they want to make money but they're not kind of colluding with each other to make as much money as possible you can assume the are coordinated to clear assumptions applies to my super majority of participants no majority adjusted or minority assumptions about network is a network synchronous our messages guaranteed to get across with in some mud very strict time bound is their partial synchronous era completely synchrony we have no idea how long messages will take to arrive outside influences so if there's an attacker that's willing to make economic rewards to participants already in the system is there a balance on the budget the amount they need willing to pay is there a balance on the amount that they actually have to pay if an attack happens so 1 comma negative critique of the crypto economic approach which focuses on incentives rather than focusing on honest majorities is basically like what about attackers that just have this really large extra protocol incentive like participants that basically just wants to watch the world work right this could be I keep watching this could be a government saying this is going to be just hackers that take over and want to have some fun so the the critique here basically says well we're assuming that you have these participants that are motivated by economic incentives and what if there's people that just wants to break the thing regardless of how how much money is on the table if they don't break the thing so there's two replies that s right one of them is that the traditional ethical honest majority driven approach actually is even more realistic because it assumed it even more unrealistic because it assumes that the majority of the participants are kind of Al Jarreau altruistically honest they're honest even if they have in centrist dishonest which is even more unrealistic than the economic approach right it's basically saying that the more than half of this network that that in order to into you have to like put in a huge pile of money with the expectation of getting more money but more than one half of these participants are going to just voluntarily for real forgo opportunities to save money and this has already been falsified right so for example a couple of years ago there was this some work that happens on the Bitcoin blockchain where miners stopped verifying blogs because they just assumed that everyone else was verifying blocks and so one in help walked on in and a bunch of other blogs got built on top of it and the ability xbox eyes to get thrown out right so we know for a fact that participants in these networks are willing to be lazy if they can get away with it and the second argument here is that while pushing the cost of attack as high as possible matters right because the higher the cost of an attack the lower the risk that there is an attacker with enough resources so not just incentive you also need resources and enough will to men give actually attack the system actually exists so another kind of version of this critique basically says well you can't assume that people don't have an incentive to break the chain because if they have an incentive to break the chain then you can just like hedge on financial markets and you can kind of have basically make money on derivatives from we're watching the watching Bitcoin price drop and so does it really matter if like 2 million of your youth get burned if you're 2 billions back by doing a short on both attacks yeah like a lot of people say this right as an argument for why I don't get on the bottle is broken but the problem with this is right then first of all there is a member in some maximum you did learn by breaking the chain right there like liking financial markets are not infinitely deep and the attacker is motivated to already have taken this maximum trick the attack if an attacker is going to try to break the chain they're going to be motivated to like me not just enough money to cover their losses but as much money as possible to benefit from the attack and there is kind of some fixed number that that is the amount of money that they can make and so if the cost of attack is higher than this number than you've won yeah if the cost of attack is lower than this number well the lower it is that the more of a risk that this kind of attack actually will happen right so there is an a very significant benefit to increasing the cost of attack and so increasing the amount of like basically kind of corresponding outside the system incentives you know you need to have in order to actually be willing to attack the champ so like for example if you're going to attack the chain then it's going to be fairly easy to make say a few thousand worth of even profits anonymously on decentralized markets but if the cost of attack goes up to a million Eve then making the corresponding amount on financial markets anonymously and getting away with it is going to be vastly harder right so the more you put you push off the requirement for how much money they need to make to offset the cost of an attack that the harder and attend the more unrealistic and attack becomes so we can look at group of work in a kind of crypts we can on the context right so you can look at it like models that say the majority of the network is honest or the majority of the network is uncoordinated or we can talk about the amount of budget in attack needs to have to be able to make an attack or we can talk about the cost of an attack of it succeeds and then we can also talk about kind of different assumptions about network sacredness so yeah or two messages arrive immediately - they arrive after 1 minute - dear wife after 10 minutes so the first column is just the usual kind of 51% arguments and the longer layer of the network we can see the more the percentage goes up because the honest Network like sometimes accidentally makes they'll blocks the second column uncoordinated the reason why not Collin what kind of looks much harsher is because of selfish minding and the cost of an attack is zero because well if you make an attacking you succeed then sure you have to go eat a bunch and like pay for a bunch of the electricity to create the attacking box which is what the budget is but you can you get paid a block reward for all of the antenna for all of the Watts that you make and so actually the total cost of the attack after factoring the rewards becomes either 0 or negative so we can look at different consensus algorithm in this way and proof of stake is actually kind of in large part about trying to take this chart and improve on it one important concept in crypto economics is this distinction between and have attributable or equally attributable fall sands of not uniquely attributable holds so I am NOT uniquely attributable fault is a fault where you know that some mistake happened but you have no idea who is responsible right so for example if you have a watch in and you have two different Forks then one of the two sides here is responsible right one of the two sides here builds on top of an old walk instead of building on top of it you work but you don't know which one you don't know whether the top chain came first or or whether the bottom chain came first like some people might know if they're watching the network closely but there's no way of proving who did what first cryptographically and so the fault here is not uniquely attributable and the problem with them uniqua attributable thoughts is that there's a limit to how much you can penalize them because if you penalize not at you've done you attributable faults too much then there's a risk that innocent people will get caught and so you're making the system much less attractive to participate it uniquely attributable faults are faults where if some actor misbehaves it can be unambiguous we should know that it was their fault so if some protocol requires me to show the results of a calculation and someone show excuse to me goes fine then that's something that you can be kind of point to and say look at this guy over here and clearly it's definitely this guy over here could be could be the mistake and published a false statement and you can give them a pretty large protocol penalty so this it kind of gets us to the goals of proof of state right so in front of stake validators have to beat the posits they have to put their youth into a smart contract in order to participate and the reason why those coins have to be walked up is so that if you validators make uniquely attributable faults if the family dinners do wrong things that they that can be identified as specifically exempt doing wrong things that you can have either protocol penalties touch these deposits and take away their the deposits and this is what weeds do an extremely high cost of attacking prove a steak that you just do not get any proof of work system the civil finality and what is finalized basically if the validator is kind of make a series of messages supporting the blog in such a way that in order to also finalize a competing blog the valid at least one-third of elevators would basically have to publicly contradict themselves so the kind of naive way to think about it is for a walk to be finalized two-thirds of people have to vote for it and so for a competing walk to be final is that two-thirds of people will also have to vote for the competing blog and so one-third of validators would have to contradict themselves and if a validator contradicts themselves you didn't take the evidence of data you can use that to penalize them in reality it's more complex than one round of voting and spend about least two rounds of voting using this clever algorithm called Kasparov FG I encourage people to learn more about counts preferred key by reading the paper on archive yay so rip of state is all about encryption we can all make septic or brute before it is all available we can all make septic or there is a lot of other things that are also available groups we did not make scepter for me what an interesting thing is that crypto economics can sometimes compete with cryptography right so for this one is useful example to think about is interactive computation so interactive computation is this kind of scalability primitive that basically is true trying to allow block chains to learn the results of complex facts about computations without actually doing the entire computation on the watching so for example suppose you have some function y equals f of X and it turns out that F it can be decomposed into this format where it's like you start with X then you apply on one then you apply F 2 then you apply a free but Laden appliance 99 to then you apply F 100 and basically you have a small value you go through a series of small values and you get Y at the end so here is a protocol for kind of how the blockchain can learn the result of this computation would now execute an ultimate on chain so you set the problem you said here is f here is X we wants to learn white you have a smart contract that contains some award and the smart contract implements this protocol anyone has the ability to submit a sequence of values basically X 1 X 2 X 3 so all of the intermediate steps of the computation and you can like you can have the individual steps how to equate a bit of computation in them right you just basically each individual step has to be small enough that you can execute an inside of a plot so the proposer submits the sequence of values X 1 X 2 X 3 all the way up to X 100 along with an opossum so this is step one step two you wait right and there's a challenge period so suppose for example that as a kind of as a simple example the the channel of the problem that we're gonna make them watching trying to solve is we're going to try to calculate to ^ town in suppose we live in a universe for multiplying by two is really hard and so we can only multiply by two once inside of a block so how do you do an interactive computation to compute 2 to the power of 10 right basically if you would have to submit all the intermediate mountains right you would submit these 10 intermediate values you would submit 1 2 4 8 16 multiply and you would submit these values and then you would have this challenge period and in the challenge period basically anyone has the ability to do kind of points to one particular value and say wait this value actually isn't 2 times 2 value before so in this case willing suppose we have this kind of evil this guy and the evil smiley face guy is just really really tired of this stupid idea that a kilobyte is a thousand and 24 bytes instead of behaving house of bytes and so this guy wants to solve the problem by convincing the world the to the power of 10 is not a thousand 24 it's actually a thousand and the evil smiley face guy is gonna do this by well submitting these ten values right these are the powers of 2 1 2 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 - and 250 500 1000 they're the powers of 2 each one is placed the other than the thing at the end of the thousand what's the big deal so within this challege period a challenger can say hmm someone has drawn on the watch in I could say 3 will I disagree with that 250 there I think I'm not doing 28 times - it's 256 and the Challenger can submit a transaction that points to this index and when that happens the calculation actually runs on the blockchain if that procedure were multiplication by 2 128 times 2 is run on the blockchain in the watch hands like wait they actually inserts 256 and this guy submitted 250 so this guy's wrong and so the original submitters deposit gets destroyed and part of the deposit is given to the Challenger as a reward so this is a group to the economic protocol right because because the ability of this protocol to work relies on incentives it relies on the penalty that the submitter gets if they submit a set of polygons oh we're one of those thousand and it also relies on this reward and that was that the Challenger can get if the detects that one of these values is wrong and they send a transaction that remember what showed us of watching which meant action is wrong allows it to be verified and allows the submission together gently now this cryptic genomic protocol basically is like in some ways the core of how optimistic roll-up works right so if anyone has seen I'm optimistic roll-up like that if you can make an exchange thing that's been floating around he's playing like this is the kind of fundamental purpose of economic math enough that protocol works on and basically how it allows scalability to happen by just doing computation off chain by default unless someone complains about some particular transaction in some particular block being incorrect so notice that the interactive computation does the same thing as the a snarks right Ziqi snarks are about doing conversation auction making a prove luncheon and allowing everyone else to just verify the proof instead of here running the entire computation themselves interactive computation does the same thing a few people run the computation option in the run descriptive economic interaction protocol and the facts of this cryptic atomic interactive protocol happens in the career on chain and everyone saw this happening it can convince people that the results of the computation is correct too much without them having to run the entire computation themselves and this is kind of the the schism between zk role of versus optimistic role which is better well they have different advantages right so snarks and do not require a challenge period so when the snark you can know the answer immediately whereas with enough m and mystic or interactive computation game you have to run of wheat of course some period of time to make sure that nobody challenged the computation snarks are less efficient so a zero knowledge proof have a very high computational overhead and with general purpose of universal machine execution the overhead goes way higher optimistic computation does not have this problem an interactive computation is also easier to implement and especially for more complicated general purpose applications then you can also look at this optimistic approach so crypto genomics is used in aetherium land for lots of things it protects the base layer of the protocols that we all know and love it protects our life clients it protects the security of our glorious and sacred layer to games plasma channel us optimistic roll up true bit it can be used for thoughts and thoughts resistance such an improved security of option messaging protocols it's so much more so this really is kind of the bedrock of what large parts of our you go system are based on and since we're what by kind of planting the seed in 2009 Satoshi a would have created a really an of interesting and great thing and now we're careful to bring things on top of it thank you

  - Video: "Coinbase Speaker Series: Vitalik Buterin"
    welcome everybody to our fireside chat we have a very special guest here today vitalik buterin and um he and i were just catching up we've known each other for a little while um so coinbase started back in 2012 and i remember um we were reading lots of bitcoin magazine at that time and i remember reading some articles written by this guy named vitalik and i think thought his writing was excellent and in 2013 we actually met for the first time at the bitcoin conference in san jose california and i think shortly thereafter um i remember he was thinking about moving to the us or coming to san francisco or something like that but i guess he couldn't get a work visa oh he was kind of stranded in canada he you know he decided to create aetherium so in like a weird way the immigration policy of the united states led to the creation of ethereum um you know russia vitalik is is russia is born in russia moved to canada when he was age six and um you know he went on a co-found ethereum and he's been one of the most prolific and influential voices in crypto so vitalik thank you for being here we're glad to have you and thank you for inviting me brian it's good to be here awesome so you know to get started um maybe you can give people just a little bit of uh lay of the land of um what's the current state of the ethereum foundation and um you know how have you how you set it up over time and your role and then you know maybe once we get through that we can get into a little bit about some of the more recent developments with um eth2 and serenity um sure so the ethereum foundation as originally created in the middle of 2014 so at the time we were somewhere around 20 or 30 different uh basically core developers that were just working on trying to make the original ethereum protocol happen and there were a lot of people in europe like berlin was a major center at the time a lot of developers there some people in london some people in the in the us and a lot of different places and so at the beginning it was basically just this kind of collection of um legal entities in a couple of countries the main one in us in switzerland and just trying to pay developers and make the ethereum protocol happen i think uh since then it's definitely expanded a lot so around the beginning of 2018 we started and announced this big grant program and we really tried to expand into you know not just paying core developers ourselves but also just supporting all of these different independent projects in the community and since then the grants program actually spends more money than the foundation does on and of paying its own people which i think in part is a deliberate choice to uh encouraging more and distributed and diverse ecosystem um one of the big recipients of the of that is just all these different of independent teams that are building ethereum two clients so prismatic uh lighthouse and nimbus are three of the biggest ones uh also some layer two project says some ethereum developer experience things ethereum community things you know security related things and this uh kind of big long list and i think it's uh and just that kind of remit is just support things that are good for the ethereum ecosystem and support things that are good for you know making the ethereum ecosystem good for the world and so whatever fits into that the foundation is kind of happy to do um so our executive director and of ayamiya guruji she is definitely kind of a bit uh behind the scenes more than some of our core developers but she and um you know josh cena and our bastion and about albert many of our other ops staff have been um doing a very good job of uh just making that happen and kind of managing this transition where we you know changed from this kind of small entity that we were back when ethereum started to this kind of big sprawling thing that's managing a huge amount of relationships and resources so that's basically where i mean the foundation is it's a very globally distributed organization um you know we have major bases and i guess switzerland singapore taipei berlin denver san francisco um and and sometimes that's that just means there's a couple of people there sometimes it means you know there's a small office and sometimes people go there sometimes people don't and otherwise you know it's basically as global as ethereum is um yeah that's who we are and and so those uh people you're referring to they're they're employees of the theorem foundation who are helping do i understand it correctly that the foundation really is defining the spec protocol and then they're also a grant making organization to those various teams that you mentioned that are implementing the spec and building node software is that right um and i could uh kind of quickly go through the list actually of just what the ethereum foundation funds directly and what a general what it funds with grants so directly there is obviously just operations of the ethereum foundation itself um then there is defcon our annual conference um there is the research team so that's mainly the team building the ethereum two specs uh it used to be the team building ethereum one specs um until that process uh kind of distributed a lot over the last couple of years um there's the people building solidity um also i mean there's a lot of just smaller different projects so like for example we have a python team that's been working on yeah the ethereum python implementation there's uh just a lot of different teams working on an individual working on different individual projects a gef is definitely an of ikea really big and important one and then as far as what we do with grants uh the ethereum two clients uh so i mentioned uh prism from prismatic lighthouse from sigma prime nimbus uh from the status team those all received a combination of uh support from the ethereum foundation and support from other organizations in the ethereum ecosystem uh there is a lot of layer two projects uh have received grants of different sizes from the ethereum foundation especially early on uh some applications and even like eunice swap started with a grant uh actually and then you know it gets said to turn into this a really big thing um academic grants so we gave quite a bit to the center for blockchain research in stanford i gave quite a bit to ic3 um also gave quite a bit to starkwear to work on some stark-related tech that we might end up using at some point and after that there's just this really big long tail makes sense that's awesome well it certainly has sparked a pretty incredible ecosystem of different projects and we can get into defy and all those things in a little bit but maybe i think i'll ask a question that's on a lot of people's minds which is um how are things progressing towards ethereum ii and serenity and maybe you can give us a timely update uh for the community on how you feel it's going and yeah what should we know uh sure uh so ethereum 2 is this uh big sprawling effort to mainly uh two upgrades to ethereum one of them is switching the consensus from proof of work to proof of stake which we believe to be much more energy efficient and you know much less tree killing require much less issuance and all of those things and at the same time more secure than proof of work and so this is actually something i wrote a blog post about like one of the most recent ones on vitalik.ca talks about this and the other big piece is sharding which is a scalability upgrade that basically means that you don't need every node to process every transaction anymore you kind of split up the load much more and this way we could increase the blockchain's throughput from around 15 transactions a second to you know many thousands or tens of thousands of transactions per second so the uh ethereum two road map is split into one of different stages or parts and we at the beginning called them phases i think recently we've been de-emphasizing the phase branding a bit because uh it's becoming kind of more paralyzed and all the pieces are being built in a and if they can be implemented when they're ready regardless of what the other pieces are doing a kind of format but the very first phase zero this is the launch of the proof-of-stake beacon chain basically just a private stake chain just maintaining consensus on itself running kind of independently from but if hooking into the eth1 blockchain this is uh something that you know from a technical perspective is basically just completely ready and it is out there right like the thing that it's waiting for is that right now there is this contract on the ethereum blockchain called a deposit contract where people can send in 32 in order to become ethereum validators and um once the amount of people or once the amount of ether in the contract reaches at 524 000 then the beacon chain kind of officially kicks off right so right now i think it's at about 100 000 and it's basically just sitting there for more people to stake um which so once that number gets above 500 then you know the chain launches which is really exciting and so we see this uh proof of sig system running um as a main network for the first time you know obviously it's been running as a test network quite successfully for uh several months uh so after that phase zero they're the next major pieces of work are and there's a lot of like minor improvements we want to make that we have wants to make now that we just couldn't fit into the spec in time so litecoin support some efficiency improvements some other things but then there's also a shorting um with and the other big piece is the piece that we call the merge or sometimes called docking which basically just means taking the entire eth1 system and actually moving it on top of these two layer and so we would basically get rid of proof of work right and kind of actually bring you know the ecosystem back into the being this one chain that's entirely based on a proof of stake so that's something that we're excited about that will have to be a bit longer because not only does the merge have to be implemented but the community has to be confident in the merge process the community has to be confident in the ethereum to chain itself um and so that will uh take uh take some time you know abandon the 50 billion dollar base layer that they know and love and move to one that we consider better but it's uh it's still a leap that people have to take and uh we want to be mindful of uh people's desire to take that leap confidently and not too rashford so that's kind of what's happening on the e2 side in the future um at the same time there is also work happening on layer 2 scaling so roll ups have been all the rage over the last year or so and roll ups are this kind of interesting hybrid layer 2 technique so no we've been looking into layer 2 for a long time right we've been doing state channel work we've been which is kind of similar to the bitcoin lending network uh we've been doing work on plasma um roll ups are this interesting compromise where unlike other lawyer two schemes they do require a little bit of data on chain they require about 16 bytes of data on chain for every transaction which is basically just like a highly compressed version of uh you know who's sending it who's the recipient basically just the information needed to reconstruct the state but not any of the any signatures or any of the information needed to verify things and it turns out that if you have that then you can build a layer 2 which is much kind of conceptually simpler and it allows general purpose smart contracts it's extremely powerful you don't have to learn a new pair a new paradigm or a new language it basically just behaves like almost a carbon copy of the ethereum base layer itself right and so we've been really actively working on that there are some great teams like optimism arbitrarum lubric zk sync um aztec all these people trying to make roll ups happy happen and roll ups by themselves and can increase ethereum scalability from around 1000 transactions or sorry from around 15 transactions a second to around 1 000 to 4 000 transactions a second depending on how complex the transaction is um and and so they're actually enough to provide quite a bit of skill scaling to the ethereum ecosystem by itself and roll-ups have already been tested on mainnet right so like you see the loop ring roll-up is running on midnight the zk-sync roll-up is running on midnight git coin has moved over to the zk sync roll up that's uh on main net but we want to have more adoption of that over time and then if you take roll ups and shorting at the same time then the scalability increases from both of those multiply and so you'll be able to go up to around 100 000 transactions a second which is you know roughly the scale that we need to basically be comfortable saying you know yes this is a platform that's ready for kind of powering significant chunks of the world economy and if we need more we can just uh get more over time just from you know just moore's law and various technical optimizations that we know are going to happen yeah yeah we can talk more about that because i'm very excited about scalability and i think that's one of the big unlocks for this industry but maybe before we get to that um how do you think about you know what's what's the time frame that you think in your best estimate that we will now be live on eth2 we'll have proof of stake we'll have um you know the scalability up you know the optimistic roll up and um all those things that you feel like would deliver the next level so when do you think that'll happen best guess so zk roll ups as i mentioned they're here already it's just an ecosystem challenge of when they get implemented or implemented and widely adopted optimistic roll ups um which so zika roll roll-ups can support payments and like a couple of other applications optimistic roll-ups can support the full evm more easily so those are already on testnet i'm expecting them to be on main net you know somewhere between one to three months from now depending on how lucky the uh implementation teams are and how many snags they run into um eth to a beacon chain obviously extremely soon it's there's literally zero things that need to be done um by us it's just a matter of when people do uh deposit and when that number gets up to five hundred thousand the etherium shorting like one to one and a half years and then the merge probably like one to two years or so i guess um we're right i'm roughly hoping yeah yeah makes sense okay well obviously that'll be an incredible moment for the crypto industry and um you know i'm curious how do you think about it inside the ethereum foundation i know that there's a number of different kind of um i call them like next generation blockchains right that are people are working on and we've got dfinity and polka dot cosmos and al goran and you know eth2 is one of those do you all think about it as kind of um i think by the way i think many of us were probably hoping that something this year would have been launched some and some of those did launch but they you know we haven't seen maybe as much progress as people were hoping um but these are hard problems they take a long time so do do y'all inside the ethereum foundation think of it as like we're in a race to do this or is it more like you know safety and good process and it's more like taking our time i don't know if here's how you all think of it internally mm-hmm and i think like getting into having a successful um you know blockchain with good features and good adoption is not just a matter of tech it's also a matter of like ecosystem and community and i mean even like ethereum itself kind of suffers from this a little bit if you look at the zk roll ups right like the z cap roll ups they're technologically great you know it's a it's uh amazing tech it exists now it exists on mainnet and so the ethereum blockchain today is fully technically capable of processing you know 4 000 payments a second if people are up to it but zk roll ups are you know they're getting some adoption but it's uh it has been a fairly slow climb and the reason for that is basically that's not just the tech that needs to get out the door it's also just people needs to actually go and implement it wallets needs to go and support it um and people needs to adjust their workflows for it people need to get used to it and all these things and so like one of the trends that we've been seeing both in the ethereum l2 space and even in the uh kind of quote if killer space is uh that a lot of them are basically trying to adopt the evm right like a lot of these killers are trying like maybe a few years ago they were marketing about how they were so much better than the evm and now they're basically marketing about how they're including the evm um and even the ethereum lawyer two projects right like the reason why people are excited about optimistic rollups so much more than you know plasma or channels or even the zk family for example is because they can just support existing evm contracts right so i think like we've learned from this and one way of describing uh the evm or the ethereum foundation's posture for about this as it's this very pragmatic one of you know how can we get to things uh that concretely improve the experience for this existing developers in their existing positions right so if someone already has an ethereum depth up with uh that they're working on like how quickly can we get to a point where we provide something that just provides concrete value for them right and optimistic roll-ups are one way are one way of making this happen i mean some of the non-scaling related things that we're doing around you know proof of stake or even just developer or wallet experiences are another example um tornado cash is a great example on the privacy side it just is like it's not an ecosystem it's a tool and i think that's an important lesson like everyone really wants to be the king of their own ecosystem but you can often often be the most useful by just building a tool and being okay with being a tool and tornado cache is just a tool and it's getting a lot of usage which has been great for the past year so the challenge that i see on the eth2 killer side is basically that most of them they do uh kind of underestimate the value of a community and and they're trying to get get their community to some extent but the problem is just that like the message that you needs to have in order to get an excellent community is not just we have great tech right like you have to have a story around why your platform is unique and valuable and you you need to have a way for this applications on your platform to be able to kind of interoperate with all of the existing applications um you need to find like basically have a way to help your uh people who are on your platform actually get users and if all of those users are people who are used to using the evm and who have their existing metamask wallets then like how are you actually going to make that happen um so there's a lot of those kinds of challenges that i think uh a lot of the people that just went and said you know oh hey yeah we got a 200 million dollar ico and we have hired some phds or some facebook employees and we can go build a technically better chain like and don't necessarily realize um and i think they're starting to realize it now and then but then even within the ethereum ecosystem itself right like we've been seeing more and more however nf tech is not the only challenge and so those are the things that we've been uh you know struggling with so yeah and i think in terms of orientation it really is just a matter of like you know hey how do we take not only build the these tools but actually get to the point where you know users of specific applications and people who are actually in the ethereum ecosystem that exists can benefit from the much better experiences that the newer technology offers yeah makes sense and i do feel like there's so many there's so many new blockchains that got created at one point and usually when industries are first starting there's kind of massive fragmentation tons of different competitors and then over time they consolidate down so i don't do do you anticipate there'll be any kind of like mergers or acquisitions or something like that and of these different blockchains to bring some of these teams together as the industry consolidates um that's a fun one i yeah we haven't seen like a coin or merger before right like yeah i guess the challenge is that that just requires a lot of coordination and it's a type of coordination that the teams are that decentralized communities are not naturally good at but maybe someone will do it successfully and show people the way you can i think even within the ethereum ecosystem there's definitely like families of projects that could easily do better if they uh combined into a single one yeah um on the uh i mean on the eve killer side like one thing that i do foresee happening is i imagine some of them are going to continue to try to pivot from being eath killers to being out of satellites uh so basically i mean some of them are doing this already right what they're talking about how oh we have this amazing system and we have a bridge and it's like right beside the ethereum ecosystem and you can bounce back and forth um and and if you wants to be a more security satellite then you can become a roll-up and the tools for being a roll-up are going to become kind of much easier over time and then you benefit from a kind of ethereum security layer um which would be nice uh and so and i do see here kind of some portion of them going going down that path and some portion are definitely going to just try building their own ecosystem and they're going to specialize in and doing something unique and interesting that ethereum does not do and i think like those are the most interesting ones right like don't just try to become a clone and you know have 10 percent better developer experience or whatever like either do something that the ethereum community is not willing to do that could mean you know having a base lawyer with very activist governance um that does things like you know protocol changes and like dow forks and having built-in price feeds and oracles or whatever and just like throw the entire kitchen sink on like a big governance blockchain uh it could mean doing something interesting with formal verification like in like the tezos vision for example like i thought was interesting in that regard i'm doing something interesting in terms of like aiming to zero knowledge if i the entire thing like uh what mina has been doing um so those kinds of projects i think are interesting and can survive but basically like i think if you're something other than ethereum you know you need to have a story for why your thing ex deserves to kind of exist and be used in in the context of an ecosystem where ethereum and where it's going already exists right and i mean that's true of ethereum as well right like ethereum itself needed to have a uh a story of why ethereum deserves to exist in the context of where bitcoin was and where bitcoin is going and that's something where i think you know we have actually managed to and get over that hump uh so and i'm confident there will be some projects that manage to do it okay cool and um what advice would you have or requests would you have for companies like coinbase or other crypto companies to help this transition happen to charting and proof of stake and scalability and serenity and everything like yeah what would you prioritize or ask companies to do i mean one thing that i think you've already been doing is kind of taking roll-ups seriously and uh trying to be active and having support for them so you know i know you're you're doing that integration with optimism right and so and just staying in touch with the roll-up ecosystem and making sure that kind of you're part of the solution in terms of getting those uh those projects adopted and getting scaling actually happening on those projects is um one big thing that and both you and of companies in general can do otherwise again can just being an easy to use gateway into the cryptos ecosystem is something that's very important and something that we continue to need um right like if someone is not in the crypto ecosystem now like how can they get in how can they buy like either a small amount of crypto just so they can use some applications or a larger amount of crypto um how uh having even just having an easy to use wallet is definitely a yeah a big part of this and and uh having a kind of easy access to all of that infrastructure um going uh kind of yeah and so i guess uh just in a lot of cases the answers sort of continue to be continuing to be good at doing what you do and continue to kind of stay abreast of all of these improvements happening in the ecosystem whether it's layer 2 scaling or it's privacy related things um whether it's you know staking um or like smart contract wallets and or whatever and to make sure that you're in participating in those things um and actually i know like coinbase on the i haven't looked in this interest in a while but on the bitcoin side like you have a multi-sig wallet where coinbase holds one of the keys right yeah yeah right and do you have that on the ethereum side yet uh yeah we have well i think you're referring to our vault product um we also have coinbase wallet which is a user controlled you know self-custody wallet so um both we have that for each on both sides yeah okay yeah and i think like having in a kind of hybrid like different forms of hybrid custody like is definitely something that i'm interested in like i've been you know i've been a like a yeah a shill for multisig ever since saying even back in 2013 i want to wrote a bitcoin magazine article about it um social recovery have been a big booster over the last couple of years so having more custody models that kind of combine the benefits of uh you know most of what you want out of self-sovereignty with most of what you want out of models that you know make sure you don't lose your funds if your house burn burns down and or you accidentally misplace that piece of paper that has like those 24 million dollar words on it i think is really important um i mean in addition to uh kind of having your own wallet that supports different custody well models the other thing we could do is try to be a kind of you know in basically general purpose uh kind of institutional custody oracle um and so the idea would be like some service where you are part of a multi-state like basically you like users would be able to kind of sign up and create an account and if they control an account they would be able to control like actions with that key and you would authenticate them using you know standard kind of um ways you would authenticate users and if things screw up you can always kyc them and so forth um and that would be done in such a way that it would integrate with other multisig wallets that would integrate with like you know it could be a social recovery guardian like something like you know plug into argent for example um i basically just make it something generic and even participate in the standardization uh kind of process for a kind of generic inc custody oracles like that to exist like that would be one interesting example of something you could do on the smart contract side and in general i think like getting more adoption of uh just smart contract wallets and these better custody wallets is like something that's been fairly high priority for me personally so any steps in our excellent steps that's awesome yeah there's probably a lot more we could do on that side coinbase wallet is our main investment in that space and we um we'd love to try some more like social recovery type options and various um multi-sig like keystore adoptions like we offer some today but i think giving more options there would be even better i guess um just zooming out for a minute uh you know i think you know we one thing i think about a lot and i think you do too is just how do we get crypto to be used by a billion people every day right how do we get it to be internet scale and i think there's a lot of lessons from the internet right we talked about one of them already the move from dial up to broadband is kind of the scalability that we talked about earlier with sharding and proof of stake and everything roll ups um there's there was also of course privacy had to be added to the internet right so it went from http to https and then you could start putting in your credit card and and feel more secure online and then i'd say the usability was another big piece where like you know they went from just ip addresses you know machine readable addresses to the dns system so you could type a human readable name and domain name i know like the ethereum name system has started doing some work there um maybe you can just zooming out kind of give us your vision for the next five years in crypto or 10 years like how do we get a billion people using this every every day um so and as you mentioned scalability i think is a hugely important part of this and i have a feeling that a lot of people still underestimate that um right because i think they might perhaps think of scalability as being you know going from ethereum as it exists today with all the properties that it has today to basically that same thing but being able to be used by a hundred times more people but the reality is right that if we have that scaling then a lot of other things are going to happen as well uh so like one example of this is the thing that like people in bitcoin land call the fidelity effect right that there's like big companies that would love to do major things in crypto but they're holding off now because they realize that like if they were to do that then they themselves would basically like single-handedly triple transaction fees and essentially just make their own product use what's just by existing and so if uh either scalability happens or we scalability gets to the point where there's a credible story that it will happen within a year um then i think there's a much higher chance that we're gonna see large enterprises just jump in and start doing useful things on chain as a result so that's one side of things and on the other side of things i think is that if we can push transit action fees down from the status quo where they're like somewhere between you know ten cents and ten dollars depending on which day of the week and like what thing it is that you're doing and down to the point where they're between you know zero point zero five cents and five cents then we can unlock a lot more different kinds of activity um right so we can unlock a lot of non-financial applications and we can unlock a lot more usage of ens we can unlock a lot more and micro payment related things and even just like simple consumer and work to merchant payments starts to kind of become viable again in a way that they're not in many smaller cases today and so when that happens like it just opens the door for and of the organic adoption that we were hoping for back in 2013 to start happening again um now obviously the actual kind of ecosystem development work on making that happen needs to happen as well um but once we have scaling that becomes possible um once we have privacy uh a lot of things become more possible and also scaling and privacy work together right because privacy unfortunately comes with the cost that privacy preserving transactions are like 10 to 30 times more expensive than regular transactions like if you look at tornado cash you know withdrawals take ten dollars or like some like crazy high amount and so not many people are gonna use it except for things that like really really need privacy um and if those fees go down to 10 cents then um you know privacy could become much more mainstream which would be yeah um awesome so that's a big side of things and then the other side and i think like wallet security once again is really important for scaling because um like people are just not going to you know mass adopt this kind of write 24 words on a piece of paper and if that paper accidentally goes in the garbage then you know so do your life savings kind of approach right like it's like you're just not going to be able to convince like 1.5 billion people to kind of go to figure out how to use that entire path and i mean i know you know even among my own friends like they find that entire procedure is scary and there's a lot of edge cases that they find scary like even things like oh it turns out that there's multiple formats for how to use the seed phrase and is your bib 32 derivation path like you know forty two zero one zero or is it forty two zero one zero zero or whatever the numbers are um and one person i know actually was uh they moved their um funds into a different wallet and was really worried that they lost two hundred thousand dollars until like i basically i uh kind of went in and did some python monkeying manually and managed to get the private key out so like this is what like this goes back to the discussion about you know like multi-sig work uh and social recovery but like even just like social recovery is the thing that already exists right like wechat uses social recovery for example to work out uh help recover your account like a lot of services uses it and actually is really intuitive and it works well right because i like people are comfortable with the idea of like oh you know put in some contacts that are some people um that that i know and i kind of collectively trust this collection of them uh so finding uh kind of security models that combine i guess the best virtues of moving away from a centralized uh kind of single institution controls everything world um together with the virtues of approaches that are actually good for people's user experiences is another thing that's important for adoption and for adoption not leading to a disasters i guess um the um and then the other challenge is of course like coming getting to the point where we have like specific applications so that a lot people wants to actually use and benefit from it and i guess in the crypto space in obviously just savings and payments are kind of the original one and they're this big thing that's definitely valuable to a lot of people again you know if you're in one of these countries that's uh experiencing hyperinflation then you know crypto is really valuable for you and even if you don't want to like hold money in crypto specifically or in you know bitcoin or eve specifically like there's now there's dye and there's usdc and there's all these assets that you can use as well um i mean payments um use and international payments crypto uh doing those really well and so and and in general kind of i think the decentralized finance spaces like is increasing the potential for what you can do there and the the challenge with d5 i think is that it's this uh it's this weird kind of combination of on the one side useful but boring things and on the other side like just useless fun things right so like for example yield farming you know fun but i think in the long term useless um like it's okay you know you can use it to kind of bootstrap a couple of projects but like yield farming is not the sort of thing that's gonna you know create a more just an echo equitable world or anything like that like yeah um but um and on the other hand um you know just really boring stuff like die like it exists people can use it it's been stable it's there in usdc it's there um i expect um what we're gonna see uh kind of syntheticified versions of like stocks and you know like tesla and the s p 500 and so forth like that'll be boring but it'll be there so i think those kinds of just boring but uh you know therefore a long time projects are the projects that are gonna be really valuable and just helping to make uh decentralized finance useful for a lot of people and and then there's also all of these things that other than financial applications so it for example in singapore there's this project called open certs which is just using the blockchain as a place to store data like certifying various kinds of certificates uh so like did someone uh go get a degree from some university it was the original use case that it's been expanding from there and that's just one of those kind of simple and dumb things where you know if you get it institutionally adopted um then it can happen and they can just quietly kind of sit there in the background and be useful and we can just have a world where there's more of these kind of easily verifiable guarantees about things um so yeah yeah like i think the open source model just expanded into you know hundreds of different industries and generally just uh expanding out and creating this kind of web of things where claims about yourself are kind of cryptographically provable by default um is something that could just unlock a whole bunch of use cases right so yeah like things don't have to be unchained by default right and like things being on completely unchained by defaults can easily wreck privacy but if you have uh you know constructions where you have a piece of data and then there's a merkle root on the data and if you want you can prove a miracle branch and if you want you can make a zika snark that proves a bunch of merkel branches and some properties about the thing in the leaf then you know you can create this powerful system where you can prove a lot of things about yourself authenticate yourself um and like that could unlock a lot of things right i mean even just one example of this is there's this long-running trade-off between like basically preserving privacy and anonymity and kind of preventing spam basically right so like a lot of social services have been migrating recently to this model where you know they had require phone verification or they require like a legal identity verification of some kind and it's uh bad for privacy in a lot of cases but one of the big problems is that if they don't do that then their entire platform just gets spams to hell um and so if you can instead prove that you're a unique human without proving which unique human you are then you know you can get like you can get the good thing without the bad thing you can have both simultaneously right so like and then there's even fancier versions of this like barrier white hat one of our developers came up with this model where you can even have zero knowledge negative reputation where basically you have one of these accounts where you prove you're a unique human nobody knows which you're human you are and you even prove that you have not been banned from the service before during one of the previous rounds in which you used it and so you know you can even have a kind of identities that just completely jumble around but you know you still have basically a vulnerability to being kicked off the service if you do something that you know that service considers bad right so you like you really get like the benefits of um uh like you get like most of the good things without most of the bad things and like we can uh kind of solve a lot of the problems that we've been having even in you know like our mainstream man of society just but without sacrificing important things like privacy but for those things to actually happen you know he needs to actually just build up this ecosystem where people do have these claims about themselves kind of published published or available in some cryptographic form and i think the crypto space gives you a lot in bootstrapping that but also a lot of that involves you know cooperating with all these different institutional actors and trying to uh kind of get them on board so i guess i see it as this a kind of sprawling collection of a lot of these different efforts right so you have grassroots adoption of payments you know they have institutional adoption of payments and you have grassroots adoption of ens you have institutional adoption of uh kind of making these kinds of certifications so you have all of these different systems for proving that you're a unique human or proving properties about yourself you have a kind of some zero knowledge proof layer for actually proving on all of these things um and we can i think and then there's also a lot of these kind of niche applications like you know there's prediction markets which have been really successful and uh have been used a lot and even just in the 2020 election for example there's uh i even saw there was this independent a news site popular uh that's writing a lot of articles and a lot of them you know cover the developing world and africa um and they have like a theory like east for tipping and an ethereum based comment system which i thought was uh really cool um so i think we'll also see just a lot of small things kind of popping up and you know it's an ecosystem and it's a network and just you have all of these different parts that just grow independently and they yeah and all mutually support each other that's awesome it's awesome yeah i totally agree i will scratch the surface here really and the usability aspects that you mentioned around multisig and all that stuff it's like it could transform the world in a way that you know we're just beginning to see the the very beginnings of it so um awesome that's a very compelling vision of the future and we're just about out of time actually we probably have like one minute left but i wanted to ask you one final question which was uh more of a personal one just for fun but you know you you became kind of this global celebrity at a young age um having invented ethereum and um you know the ethereum has the community has this very unique culture with like memes and unicorns and rainbows and stuff like that and cats does that did that kind of come from your personality and i guess maybe you can give us a little bit of an insight into how that came to be and what your life like how your life turned out as a result of that yeah and i think like it's definitely a kind of combination of uh you know the kind of cultural values of and both myself and some of the other uh kind of people in ethereum that were there early on like basically just uh kind of don't take life too seriously and uh you know don't like you definitely you kind of don't be um you know aggressive and gruff like some of the maximalists on twitter are um just like not being bad is definitely one of the and of being very clear to the world that we're not that was uh you know definitely some part of the motivation um just uh being uh kind of open and welcoming i think as a really important kind of value and uh kind of represents what what crypto is uh is about for a lot of us um it's um it's definitely a kind of turning and turned into a a very interesting aesthetic and you know we yeah we love our unicorns and our um and and our cats now and let's say and if everywhere in def con and in the yeah i know and i think the goal is definitely to kind of make people feel welcome and to just like be uh be as friendly as we can and to just like remind ourselves about the lighter side of a side of life i guess so i hope it's been succeeding yeah i think it has and uh thank you for all the work that you're doing i think it's it's very important for the world and hopefully we at coinbase and the rest of the community can figure out a way to help and help go create the crypto economy more economic freedom in the world and all the things that this can do so thank you so much for the time vitalik i appreciate it and um hopefully we'll see each other again soon thank you brian yeah alrighty have a good day bye

  - Video: "Vitalik Buterin on Ethereum merge | Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto 10.08.2022"
    okay so today what i wanted to talk about is some of the stuff that's going to happen in ethereum over the next couple of years but also talk about it from the point of view not just of like what's going to happen with the technology but also from the point of view of like what does this actually mean for people and who are building things on ethereum uh so what probably the biggest news this year Ethereum merge right is uh the merge is coming and so the merge is uh so ethereum's wish to prove a stake this effort that we have been working on for basically the last eight um eight years right so the first uh on a blog post that we wrote about proof of stake was uh in back in january 2014 and in the years since then a lot of research has happened in uh 2017-2018 we converged on what we call the beacon chain today the version of group of stakes that we ended up actually implementing um one and a half years ago the beacon chain was actually launched and so pretty soon uh what's going to happen is um this complete switch where ethereum finally switches over to being a pure proof of stake system and basically what happens there is um the ethereum's application layer so the applications the smart contracts balances everything that happens happening inside of ethereum is going to be automatically moved off of the proof of work chain which will basically just like stop being uh functional at that point and move over to the improved state chain right so after the merch ethereum will finally become a proof of stake system yay so now the merge is only the first step in Ethereum scalability this fairly long and complicated roadmap that we have right so after the merge there's a bunch of other things that we have planned on focusing on but probably the biggest focus immediately after the merge is going to come on scalability right so scalability is also a problem that we've been talking about we've been complaining about we've been thinking about how to fix pretty much since the beginning of the ethereum project and that even before the chain launched them all those years ago and it's uh something where we've been actively thinking about it there have been a lot of groups that have been actively developing solutions and there's a lot that has happened over the last couple of years in the layer two space in particular right so some of the roll-up projects so projects like optimism arbitrage uh you know zkc loop rings roll starter dash on you know this big long list of uh things is uh exists now um and that's uh that's something that did not exist at all um you know three years ago and it's just made a huge amount of progress over even the last year right but there's even more work on uh scalability lots to go so people who have been following the ethereum core development process might have heard of prototank charting um so this is this uh one of the next big eips that is in the process of development and is coming to ethereum after the merge so basically the goal of prototank sharding is to create what we call these data transactions that have these data blobs and the point of this is to just increase the capacity of the ethereum chain to hold a much larger amount of data right and there is this very nice synergy between these data blobs and layer 2 roll-up projects because roll-ups can are very good at scaling transactions but they need some space to put their data and expanding the blockchain's ability to hold more data so that these layer two rollout projects can use is exactly um what prototyping charting is about right now prototank charting as you can tell from the name it's only the first step right so after prototyping starting there's going to be a second step which is just called date sharding and date charting will massively increase the number of these data blocks that the chain can hold uh but so that's the long-term roadmap right the long-term roadmap is to basically increase the amount of data that the ethereum chain can hold up to somewhere around 16 megabytes every swat right and today the average block is only about 80 kilobytes so i'm massively increasing the amount of data that the ethereum chain can hold um and it's done over the next a couple of stages prototype sharing is the first stage and even prototank sharding by itself is going to be a big improvement over on how much data the ethereum chain can hold today now at the same time as improving how much data the ethereum chain can hold there's Ethereum data compression also another effort that's happening at the same time which is improving how much data roll-ups use right so this is uh so data compression in roll-ups this is uh something that i've talked for a long time about as something that really needs to happen uh basically trying to pack a much larger number of transactions into a much smaller amount of space so that like we just get um you know a big scalability gain for free right we can pack more transactions without really having to spend more resources at all so this is just a that's a chart that i published about a week ago that kind of shows the different stages and like how much you could do right so a transaction by itself this is an erc20 token transfer takes about 188 bytes and if you add like different forms of compression so taking out zero bytes gets you down to 154 bytes i'm doing some signature aggregation takes it down to 128 making a stateless compression even better 75 and then even more advanced compression that kind of we're like decompression algorithm to walk into the chain and look into the history you can go all the way down to 23. right so there's like a lot of this work is work that's actually started to happen so a couple of months ago um optimism actually implemented as eurobike compression um and erc 4337 is also an effort that's been really picking up steam more than over the last couple of months right so a lot of effort to help the ethereum chain uh hold a lot more data and a lot of effort to help every individual transaction in a roll-up huge less data so we're talking about ethereum over the next couple of years being able to process a much larger amount of transactions than it has been able to before right so what do these two things mean for ethereum right so these are not the only two technical What does this mean for Ethereum upgrades that are happening to ethereum but there's probably the two most important ones right but you know what what does this actually mean for ethereum from the point of view of someone using it or someone building on it uh so starting off with the merge right so the merge is going to happen first so ethereum's energy consumption will be reduced by more than 99.9 percent [Applause] yeah so um you know it's a big improvement um obviously um in addition to this there's a bunch of ways in which rooms take improv and improve security and also the merge More upgrades opens the door to more upgrades right so at the same time as being a switch from proof of work to breast dig it's also an opportunity to kind of take some of the ideas that we've learned over the last like eight years and use that to really redefine um what the different parts of the ethereum chain so like for example um the merge will also make ethereum much more friendly to light clients right so today if you want to access the ethereum chain like a lot of most people generally use like some wallet like metamask and the way those wallets work is they talk to a server and to basically trust whatever answers the server gives them so with uh light clients um after the merge but once that tech is developed you will be able to like basically have a client that actually verifies the data that it gets back so basically the merge isn't just about the merge the merge is also about other things down the line that the merge is going to enable so that's the merge uh prototake charting so opens up more data space transactions will become cheaper and compression means the transactions get even cheaper again right cheap cheap cheap yay so yeah i don't know i don't know i mean i know there's you know inflation and like eight and a half percent and like gas prices are going up but like here gas prices are going down [Applause] Lower transaction fees so what can we do with a safer blockchain and cheaper transactions right i think this is uh probably the big question um so probably one of the big and really important things is just lower transaction fees are the thing and the only thing that can make blockchains affordable for anyone right so um median income per day in canada at least according to the the data at the spell link here is about 113 um dollars so this is all in us dollars just to kind of just put whatever put all the different countries in the same unit um in poland a median income per day is uh 42. um in mongolia goes down to 16 dollars and in zambia goes down to four dollars right so very big differences um and we can compare against these numbers average transaction fees on ethereum for the last couple of years now obviously they've gone up and down a lot but generally they've been somewhere in between one and twenty dollars right now today if your transaction fees are fortunately a bit lower but um you know that's because we're in a bit of a bear market at least relative to you know 2021 uh so that's obviously not something that we can count on right like it said like basically if um you know if we see one of these uh Cheap transaction fees both cycles uh pop up again anytime soon then like you know even the cheap transaction fees that we see today you know it's not gonna happen or no fees are gonna go crazy again right um so that's on the ethereum base player right and if you if you take let's say in the middle of that range like would take about five dollars then you can see how you know to a lot of canadians and like it's you know it can be affordable to send blockchain transactions for a lot of applications but if we're talking about like blockchains being this global thing that's supposed to you know empower people who are not empowered today um in um underprivileged countries then you can see how it starts looking less viable right because we're talking about single transactions potentially taking up people's entire daily income and one of the things that you actually see if you visit some of these voices as we have right is that People dont love blockchains a lot of the time people do love watching that you love uh cryptocurrency i should say they love cryptocurrency but they don't love blockchains that's probably the way to put it right because uh what you actually see often enough is that people have cryptocurrency but they have it in binance wallets right like you even see you know entire ecosystem is where that just it's just accepted that everyone has a finance wallet and that and like sending from by applying its wallet to a binding solid is the way that you make transactions right so why does this happen well obviously right if the blockchain is too expensive people are going to look for something else that's like just a fact and it's the fact that we have to deal with and so if we want to actually wants to have a world where like we can have watching activity happening without needing to trust centralized exchanges for everything then we just have to learn how to make blockchains cheaper now today with rollups um it's already sometimes 25 cents sometimes less than 25 cents and if you just like analyze what's going to happen as a result of the improvements to roll-ups that i mentioned in the future then we're talking about potential fees of maybe five cents or maybe even as low as 0.2 cents so massively cheaper transactions to the point where the unchanged transactions actually will become affordable for lots of people for whom they are not affordable today um bringing back crypto payments so this Bring back crypto payments is uh an interesting idea right basically yeah for those who and who here has been in the crypto space since at least uh 2013. um who here has read the bitcoin white paper who here remembers the title of the bitcoin white paper um acute bitcoin appear to be area electronic cash system right like you know back in the good old days people thought blockchains were for paying people so yeah right so so you know even like back in this this picture um i'm curious does anyone recognize well which city and uh where this is from it's not toronto um it is uh Inperson bitcoin payments i believe this is actually berlin this is uh the bitcoin keys um basically it's uh this is um there was an effort in uh 2013 um where uh people tried really hard to like get a lot of people to move to one place and to get a lot of restaurants like in the same region to all accept bitcoin at the same time and there was like this big social movement where people were really excited about like just trying to get an in-person bitcoin economy happening right and it started and it continued for some time but fast forward a few years later and people have mostly kind of stopped about talking about these things right and i think one of the reasons why is basically because blockchains for in-person payments so it just started stopped looking as attractive as it did before right and fees are just an obvious reason why right back in 2013 the uh one of the main arguments for why you should accept bitcoin was fees right the argument basically was like look paypal and the credit companies are very mean to us they charge uh 29 cents plus 2.9 percent for transactions and they charge even more if it's international and so if you use a if you send the payments bitcoin well the transaction fees are one cent right and this was the arguments and this was like the pitch by which the first wave of merchant adoption happened now since then that that argument has basically just become really false now if blockchains can scale then guess what the argument becomes true again and so we're in a future where blockchains are cheap and we have even more network effects than we did before so the question is if we have much more Crypto payments scalable blockchains can we actually bring uh bring back crypto payments and i think it's something that's going to be worth trying right now crypto payments are something that exists in a lot of different ways right so there's crypto payments on the internet right lots of people use cryptocurrency for international payments already like it's just something that happens quietly and like people who do it you know they they just quiet and quietly do it but there's no reason for them to make a big marketing pitch and and announce it and so it is happening but you know there are a lot of cases where more of it could be happening and it just isn't happening yet uh so there's people there but there's also kind of consumer to put some merchant payments like paying for goods or businesses there is also um in-person payments right so in-person payments we tried to do and i think it may be worth trying to do again uh there are obviously micro payments there's many different kinds of payments right but this is uh the sort of thing that like today is a fairly niche thing but i think especially with blockchains being much more affordable it is something that could grow much more in the future um non-financial applications right so one of the big things about ethereum is like ethereum is not just a payment system right and there's supposed to be this like big um array of all these other amazing things that you can use blockchains to do uh so um ens is probably the big one uh so uh who here has used a non-financial application on ethereum that's not ems who here has used dns Ens right so ens is like by far the most popular uh non-financial application on the ethereum watch it right and i think the reason why it's pretty clear it's just a really valuable and useful tool um and i think the interesting thing about ens is that it's like one piece of a puzzle that where there are a couple of other pieces that are very complimentary to it that can help to like actually create basically like some kind of decentralized identity ecosystem on top of ethereum right so you have ens and ens gives you once you have a username without that username being tied to a company that controls it um account management right so let's say who's here remembers pgp Crypto Wars 1990s crypto wars everyone has their own you know public tea web of trust right there was this really big idealistic effort to try to kind of create this ecosystem where everyone would have their own cryptographic key and with these people would be able to sign messages and be able to encrypt messages we'd have privacy we would have security and like all without having to rely on intermediaries but the network effects never really had never really happened and it just sort of never really panned out well right now fast forward to today we have millions of people with uh crypto wallets and we have millions of people that have private keys inside their own browsers now why right well because they want to trade monkey pictures right so it's like you know 1990s you know you have these really kind of deep and philosophical arguments about like oh you know there is a there's this fundamental great battle between the authority of the nation state and the desire for individual freedom and if you want to protect privacy and if you want to assert your independence that cryptography is the future of of uh ensuring freedom of this humanity fast forward 20 years and it's like hey look it's a monkey and guess which one works better so now as a but like so this is like in my one of the kind of interesting double double edged swords of the crypto space right it's like the problem with the pre-crypto sort of idealistic decentralized tech movement is that it never had enough incentives the problem with the crypto space is that like it has great incentives but at the same time it has incentives to like go in very weird directions sometimes right so at the same time though like we have actually created this ecosystem where lots of people have cryptographic keys and we actually get the possibility of using these cryptographic keys for other applications and not just stuff on the blockchain so there's this project called signing with ethereum where you can use your ethereum wallet as a way to sign into web services so if you go to chat.blogscan.com you know you actually see there's like a chat application it's basically like a telegram clone except you don't have to give up give your phone number to use it you just like use your phone use your if you're signed in with your ethereum account and you know like anyone who has an ethereum address basically already has a chat blogscan.com account um and you know if you know someone's the nf state you can go send them a message i mean you can send me a message i probably won't read it but you know you can send me a message um now so i think um sign in with ethereum is like one of those things that kind of expects to start slowly growing more and more over time right um now one of the problems though is that if you just use cryptographic keys as your wallet as your account then like what happens if your key gets stolen what happens if you lose your key what happens if like any kind of accident happens now one of the kind of pitches that sometimes uh you know traditional web 2 companies argue about like you know why google should control your account and why it's good is because they give you account recovery right it's like if you lose your account or if something bad happens there's like people and you can appeal to those people and those people can give you your accounts back now like my personal experience with this argument is that it's like somehow actually not true right like i've actually like i've i've personally talked to people who've had like trouble with their accounts with a lot of these website services and they just like often they just can't get like get their problem fixed like they reach out to support reach out the support and they just like get stuck i mean like i personally a few months ago like i had my amazon accounts um you know flags you know like some suspicious activity thing because i dare travel between different countries um and then you know there's a form and like filled in the form and at some point they said okay well we filled in the form but we don't have enough information and like you know please hold on and like basically i i have not gotten my amazon account back right so what two companies are like you know they talk about how you know centralization is good because uh like you at least provides recovery but like somehow they screwed this up so much that often they don't actually provide recovery so what can we do so what if we could do this better right so for the last couple of years i've been talking about this concept of social recovery where like you can choose you know who your recovery contacts are right and like you can make whatever choices you want so you can say i'm going to have five recovery contacts two of them are going to be an institution one of them could be my employer one of them could be my dad one of them can be a friend and any three of those five i can come together and recover your accounts and kind of reset your key to something else right and this is something that you can put into the rules on a smart contract put that on chain uh so Smart contract wallets this is um you know it's a very simple approach um and it's uh i think a sort of a model of security that is like both very decentralized right like you're not giving up your control to any one single person um and it relies on forms of trust that people have and that people are good at right like i think people and especially less technical and normal people are going to be better at picking seven to seven friends that they trust and they are going to be like writing down 24 words and making sure they write down write it down correctly making sure this weird piece of paper is like they're going to be able to keep it for 10 years and not lose it or get it still whenever um but you know so it's like actually a great solution but implementing it correctly requires smart contract wallets so fortunately smart contract wallets are actually coming now interestingly enough smart contract wallets themselves so like actually being able to track like when these account recoveries happen when these key changes happen this itself requires a blockchain right so it's like instead of using your accounts to log into or using your kind of off chain accounts to interact with stuff on the blockchain it's like no you're using your account which is on the blockchain to sign into services that can themselves also be centralized services that live on um off-chain right so you can use the same account to sign into on-chain stuff and document them so that's um the second piece of the puzzle Proof of humanity third piece of the puzzle at the stations right so uh you know it would be nice for example if you can prove that that your account actually is a human and that it's not a bot right so this is something that like for example in the context of social media a lot of people care about right so you know if he wants to improve the quality of social media and like reduce the level of terrible stuff um without kind of you know trying to impose political like specific political opinions or like control over directions or whatever one very simple thing that you could do is just make sure that you know the people who are posting actually are people instead of being like some like uh kind of farm where you have one person controlling five thousand accounts the robot right but if you want to do this then like you have to be able to actually tell you know who the real humans are and who the bots are now fortunately on chain attestations um can actually help right so like if you use your ethereum account to sign into a service the service can actually go and inspect like first of all has this account ever sent a transaction right sending a transaction requires paying a transaction fee so just whether or not you send the transaction is like the simplest possible filter that makes it hard to create ten thousand fake accounts um just by making it really expensive step two um you can look at like things that that account has done you can check for a proof of humanity profile you can check for like a pope uh you know it's a token that proves that you attended some particular event right there's like a lot of different things that you can check for and once you do that then like you can get some kind of like better indication of like well how likely is it that this account actually is a unique person now this is something that we can improve over time so we can combine it with you know fantasy or not much stuff and we can improve privacy and you can do really fancy and cool stuff like prove you're a human without revealing which human you are right so we can have kind of privacy and uh better security at the same time now these are all different kind of pieces that really fit into each other right so you want to have an account in order to sign into services and interact with services now with that you want your accounts to have a name if you want to have a name ens is Ethereum identity ecosystem great for that if you have an account you want to be able to like manage that account be able to change the key do security stuff on chain smart contract wallets and you want to prove things about yourself unchained at the stations or off-chain at the stations could um kind of with proofs attached to the work as well right so all of these pieces really fit together into this kind of ethereum identity ecosystem and like to me this is probably like the best candidate for sort of ethereum's second major app um aside from the the d5 ecosystem so that's not financial applications um dao's i think are also interesting right and dow's i think we've seen a lot of like big deals but we can find we can also see a lot like we could see more micro scale now just like five or ten friends coming together for some amount of time and pooling a few thousand dollars together for some community activities so things that are kind of a little bit too simple to create an entire corporation around but where he still wants to you know have the money be on chain and like have some um to kind of make decisions together and have some transparency so all of these things could be done on chain right but making it viable and making people wants to do these things on chain requires the chain to be much more affordable um there's enterprise blockchain use Enterprise blockchain cases as well right so people have been talking about enterprise watching use cases for years um and i think in this case like we don't actually need like fancy um you know roll-ups and protein bank charting for this there's a structure called a volitium that people that have been looking into and building more and more basically it's like you do things in a server and you do and you kind of do execute things in a centralized way but then you use cryptographic proofs like ziggy snarks and you publish them on chain and that way you have a regular record that basically proves that the changes that are happening are changes that actually are following the rules and because you're publishing on chain you can prove that you're not giving different evidence to different people and you can prove that the system isn't like reverting anything and then stop moving backwards right so these are this is also technology that is rapidly improving it's rapidly improved a lot over the last two years and especially i think with some of the zika evm stuff that's happening it's going to improve even further um so i think these are like some of the consequences that are going to happen from the technical improvements that are happening in ethereum over the next couple of years right but there are other technical improvements so the ethereum chain might in the future become not just cheaper but also faster instead of including your transaction after half a minute we might be able to provide confirmations after some shorter period of time what kinds of things will that make easier what about improvements to privacy right well like what what can we do more of if ethereum becomes a more privacy preserving system what will better middleware unlock right so if people build applications are there applications that other applications can talk to where if you make one application good that itself opens space for even more applications i mean i don't know but i think uh these are all questions worth thinking about right so yeah this is uh this is basically what what i want what i hope that we can start thinking about more right the technical improvements are happening and they're going to happen but like what kinds of improvements in terms of what we use ethereum for are these things going to make possible thank you

    um so i will um get right into the presentation um so um one of the big topics that i have talked about many times at this conference and many times at other conferences is a scaling um scaling is uh one of the biggest uh challenges of watching space blockchains today are good at decentralization and they're good at security but they are not good at being able to process more than a very small number of transactions and up until a couple of years ago i mean this was okay because up until a couple of years ago there were not that many users but now more recently like we've seen the number of people who wants to use blockchains go up but we've seen the number of uh different things that people want to do on blockchains um increase quite a bit we have d5 we have nfts we have taos we have enterprise applications um just a lot of different use cases a lot of different things that people want to do and blockchains have to expand that to provide space for all of these uh applications and for all of these new people that one that wants to use them now there's an easy way to scale watch it and there's a hard way to stop watching the easy way to scale blockchains is to just say increase the block size increase the gas limit um just increase the parameters and just let the chain process a much larger number of transactions um but the problem with this approach is it seems easy but it sacrifices decentralization um it changes the trying to scale by creating this one big uh powerful system where every single node needs to process a huge number of transactions didn't just very easily sacrifice all of their decentralization because very few people are willing to run notes now the other way to scale watch it and the more sustainable way to scale watch hands is using layers of technology so there are many kinds of layers and technology um so bitcoin for example uses channels that has a lightning network um in ethereum there are there are applications using channels as well there are a few applications using plasma but the most powerful and of course the general purpose uh technology is uh called roll-ups now the idea behind roll-ups um is one that existed in different forms since at least 2014 but it was only really put together around the end of 2019 and in uh 2020 i made this post that is uh on the slide now um roll up century road roadmap for a theory and what i talk about there is a next one what i talked about there is this idea that we need some healing right now um and it's going to take a long time for ethereum itself to develop any kind of like native built-in scaling so what i mean there is what we call starting an execute sharding execution right so shorting where every single chart can now process transactions there's a lot of technical challenges in effect doing this well it takes a long time to do well um so we can wait um or it would take we would have to wait a long time for that to uh actually happen um now roll-ups are here today um the idea behind roloffs was known since 2019 um and there are already yeah several roll-up projects that have launched some kind of alpha version that's already on maintenance um there is uh roll-ups work we know that roll-ups can't work we know that roll-ups are fully general purpose and we know that roll-ups can give a significant increase in scalability up to a factor of 100 today and data sharden which is a simpler form of a sharding that and instead of trying to create very powerful shards that can process transactions only creates shards with that store and um this is a similar kind of charting and with this kind of charting um we can increase the scalability of roll-ups by another factor of 100. so there is a very clear path to scaling with roll-ups roll-ups can provide a lot of scaling we know that they can't provide a lot of scaling and so this is the only logical scaling path for the ethereum paper system next slide so the difference between last year and this year is that last year um using roll-ups for scaling mostly was still just theory and so blue brain existed last year um but other rollups did not get exist last year but this year there are many robots that are on maintenance and you can see how they have much cheaper transaction fees than the uh that the ethereum network does um even today and you can see now i expect that these numbers will continue to decrease even further um there are quite a few optimizations uh to how you can use world ups without a decrease in the amount of data that they need to store on chain and uh so decrease the the gas cost of role transactions so blueprint for example already uses a lot of a lot of the optimizations so it's it is already at least 30 times cheaper than the yeah um now the optimism and arbitrary do not can't have these optimizations but they're working on them and when they do um optimism and arbitrarily will also become much cheaper um so with one way or two this we can already get a transaction fees load uh to a level where like at least it's lower than the environment than they were even the last year and then when we add shortening we can then decrease the transaction fees even further um next one now there are many kinds of uh roll-up technologies um and there are many kinds of technologies that are part of rolex um but there are two main uh types of roll-ups today there's optimistic roll-ups and then there's eq roll-ups um optimistic roll-ups use a technology called fraud burst for security and zika roll-ups use a zero knowledge boost for security now optimistic worlds and zika roll-ups have different advantages i think the main uh the main advantage of optimistic roll-ups is that the technology is simpler and so it is easier to build an optimistic world today especially for general purpose applications like ethereum smart contracts um zika rollover complexity is higher the benefit is that they have stronger security um they support very fast withdrawals instead of uh withdrawals taking one week withdrawals can happen very quickly but yes the technology i think is not quite there yet today but i think within a couple of years um zika roll-ups that support the full ethereum virtual machine the fallout edm will exist and you'll be able to use them um so in short-term optimistic roll-ups i think in the medium and long-term um all roll-ups are going to become tk roll-ups i think once we have data sharpening our side chains are going to become the smg roll-ups i even think that for enterprise applications once this technology is finished there is no value in having a separate private watch in um you can just have a cj roll if you have it use a ct roll up that is connected to antibody and ethereum then the fees will still be low but you will be able to get the benefit of being connected to the ethereum public watching that ecosystem next slide so the technology is making a lot of progress and there's a lot of people that are already starting to move their their applications to roll-ups or think about what their applications will look like in the context of a camera ecosystem but there is still a lot of work that needs to be done um so you can look at the work that applications need to do and we can look at the work that needs to be done on the infrastructure side so if you are an application developer then you should be very actively working at how you can move to a roll-up as quickly and as safely as possible now there are different applications and different applications work differently i think for non-financial applications in particular um moving to roll-ups is even more important because uh reducing fees is even more important because for not financial applications for applications that are not financial users are not as willing to pay high fees for them and also a lot of these applications are fairly self-contained so users within that one application are more likely to just talk to users of that other application so like games for example right so for example the uh the dark forest game uh this is the ck uh again and the this is the case in our face that like fully get a decentralized fully trust unless um if you're in the basement game that uh brian blue came up with um that's an example of something that he doesn't want a test uh on a test network now but can move to a little bit in the future um nft is exciting most of the roll-ups um enos can revolve on on the infrastructure side can that move to roll-ups and financial applications can move to roll ups um payments uh so just using uh cryptocurrency for payments i can't move to roll-ups daos maybe we'll start a living enroll inside of go up soon um so different for different applications the process will be different and each application will have to think about whether it moves completely to one roll-up or whether it supports every roll-up or whether the application continues to live on the if you're in main chain but there are bridges to roll-ups there are different ways to uh upgrade to roll-ups and every application needs to think about this now infrastructure infrastructure is so clearly core and very important applications or pieces of the ecosystem that every user or every application or at least very many users and applications um in turn use as part of using ethereum and so ens is the ethereum system we get decentralized domain name system on top of ethereum is a very important piece of infrastructure that a lot of ethereum users said yes i have an ens name a lot of ethereum people have dns names a lot of my blog has an ens name and if you go to uh metallic.eve in a browser with ems enabled um you can listen you can see my blog so more and more do more using ems but the problem with ens today is that everything is done on the main chain and so transaction fees are higher so this is one infrastructure challenge so i'm moving roll ups or moving dns over so that dns can live inside of ours um like clients are infrastructure um we get if we want if they're in the if you're in ecosystem to be decentralized it needs to have secure white clients and these secure elect clients need to be able to access not just the ethereum main chain but also roll-ups and bridges and easy ways to move from one roll-up to another without having to go through the ethereum network and wait a long time and to pay a very highly uh next slide so efp3668 during um this is a proposal to allow on both ens and other applications to move to roll-ups um and the proposal wasn't nice because it's a very general purpose um it basically it allows the contra smart contracts on layer one to specify where um applications or where information about um where to um state uh can be uh can be obtained from um and it allows them to specify a function for verifying proofs of that information so you can have uh trabus police white clients of that verified groups of data in these layer 2 protocols and so you can have dns names that are registered and transferred and uh updated inside of layer 2 and whatever layer 2 they are in if you will be uh users will be able to see the information using the same software i'm so very general um ems makers will be able to be moved to are going to register some domains can be registered and the nsdopens can be updated in ap roll-up would be very amazing um so this is a very important set of words in progress uh next slide so white clients um like clients uh allow a hypno to verify and watching um without having to run a full client that verifies uh every single transaction by themselves like blinds are very important for again watching ecosystems would be decentralized um and one of the things that we are doing with the in the uh if you're a proof of stake operator for ethereum is we are adding support for the much more powerful litecoin uh system that is possible with a proof of work today um so this is actually part of the uh all tear uh hard fork on the state proof of stake in engine um that is coming later this week um it adds this concept of synthetics and it adds this this algorithm that allows clients to uh or that allows white clients uh to verify uh blocks that have been signed by listening committees um and so it should be possible to have a secure litecoin so be able to access the blockchain without trusting a centralized server um inside a browser on your phone maybe in embedded devices maybe as part of a bridge inside another watching and so a lot of advantages but this election system is also something that needs to be extended to the role of ecosystem and so it's important that the as we scale we maintain our decentralization and all of the things that we are doing to increase the decentralization of the ethereum maintenance also carry over and apply to everything that is happening in these layer 2 protocols and next one so uh bridges um there are so the challenge is basically that transactions inside of uh optimism are cheap transactions inside of arbitral are cheaper um and the transactions inside of lubricator choose transactions inside the polygon are achieved but what if you want to move some assets from obstacles up to our control or from optimism to break um this is uh this is harder the only way that exists to do this for all lawyers who is right now is to withdraw the assets for one roll-up and then deposit the assets into another world and this requires an expensive transaction on the ethereum maintenance so it requires paying high fees with bridges it should be possible to move assets from one roll up directly into another roll-up without touching your base chain so without paying the much higher fees that there are there are projects trying to do this there are ideas for how to do this but this is still something that is being worked on this is still something that needs to be tested and implemented much more um the um it is possible too and we should be able to build uh much more decentralized across rural bridges so still a lot of progress has been made but a lot more progress needs to be made um next slide so conclusions um so layer two is the future of ethereum scaling um scaling with layer twos is the only safe and uh way to scale blockchains while preserving the uh decentralization that is so core to the watching content and evm compatible um roll-ups exist and they are very powerful uh because they provide scale um they but they also preserve uh user experience they preserve developer experience so developing for a roll-up is exactly the same as developing for ethereum with very minor changes like for example blocks might come at different times but smart contracts work the same way evm works the same way evm compatible roll-ups preserve all of these features of ethereum and they also preserve this really important property of ethereum's decentralization now at the same time this is a work in progress more work on infrastructure is still required there's still a lot of things that applications need to do there's still a lot of things that the ecosystem needs to do but finally the path to ethereum scaling is now not just an idea it is a very clear roadmap where many of the pieces of that program are have either already been developed and already been released to a maintenance or are well on their way in progress um and uh there is a lot of a lot more exciting work that is still left to be done here so very excited for the future of that interior

  - Video: "Vitalik Buterin (3.12.18)"
    Oh so what I wanted to talk about today is kind of some of my more recent views on like basically what specific underlying reasons there are four wide watching based applications that have actually can outperform like basically the centralized things that are deviating against because I think we've seen a lot of hype that all kind of go through a bit and then we've also seen a lot of desperation which is really just the hype of the pair's so like basically what I wanted to do is try to kind of sort through both of those things and trends and come up with much more specific and concrete and deeper reasons why for certain kinds of applications absolutely speaking part or all of it on a watch it makes a lot of sense so first of all what's the point of a watch and the paschal can buy on Thursday s spread so people talk about decentralization yeah who's here does not like decentralization what does not like decentralization who's here thinks that the UK government that's literally kitchen with my wizards okay so for the second for the first which is also a censorship resistance right so in theory I could have always been originally advertised as a platform that allows my decentralized applications to run quote without fraud censorship can cut off the heads of things like a Napster but bits worth is another story and so on and so forth so openness inclusivity you might hear in the term of Financial Inclusion thinking the unbanked on banking the banks they're also fairness and by fairness we both mean kind of thing kind of in a very broad philosophical sense so it's trying to make the economy fair but also in kind of very narrow sensation like for example we took one category of watching applications does provably fair gambling which is like a very small sector of the economy but it's still legitimately interesting because it really does allow you to and have designed gambling services in such a way that to overruns that literally can't cheat which is something that you really can't do to this incentive for right so these are some of the things that people tend to talk about but you know of course people talk about things like Ledger's and immutability as well but ultimately if you ask them why wonders why immutability these are kind of some of the goals that they go after so what are some of the challenges in each of these ideas right so the centralization while there's definitely people who Lobby centralization but the kind of ideological constituency for a decentralization as an end in itself as realistically fairly small right so there's a lot of attempts of doing things like decentralized winners decentralized social networks I mean even going kind of outside of the tech sector to things like seasteading and so forth and the size of people that are willing to like basically it sacrifice network you look at the comforts of network effects for and just pure abstract ideals as probably not small enough to take the watch or base to the next level so you have to ask you know what concrete things do we hope to get out of decentralization what specific property do you want your application to achieve with the centralization that would be significantly harder for it to achieve without decentralization and also how much decentralization arms consortium chains with just five banks talking to each other decentralized enough censorship resist this so if you're a political dissident yay if you're someone in Venezuela looking to move your money out yay if you're a gambler yay if you're a we know through the SBA and there is a kind of long and degreasing list of things for which you know if you are one of those constituencies you can either link to the goal but especially as you move to Ana broader sense of users than the clientele for kind of really wanting strong censorship resistance and especially spices in things like and things like efficiency and usability event at least present date watch chains were basically require you to me cuz I fairly limited openness so sure openness is great but you know if you're developing or user your kind of skeptical of the technology this is another one of those kind of nice sounding faraway sort of floppy words but what kind of concrete things you gain by being open inclusivity so developed countries page in a lot of places people just say traditional payments replying what's the problem you know you've got demo developing countries and how can we exactly get these bitcoins again oh right right you have to walk like 1500 kilometres to get to a lemonade stand others of exchange and the animal is still like fairness so basically a couple of people I think would ask would be when is the last time a centralized apathy prodded me and compared to what is the last time I lost one each from my privacy getting stolen or before music my private key so where do I actually disagree with the naysayers right so first of all I think don't discount censorship resistance so applications that you use censorship resistance to achieve things that people really value and container people successful BitTorrent is probably why move very successful example and BitTorrent is interesting because there's this kind of fairly prominent theory that a lot of in social value is interact which is it's not just about the file is directly shared over the network it's also about like basically acting like a stick and prodding people like neck like Netflix to offer better terms corporate censorship not just governments also like I go around different country as I keep talking to government regular and you know even in you know a furious faraway lands and places like Southeast Asia they seem friendly they seem to wants to support the technology board but then even despite all these words in each of these voices in a watching projects themselves have a serious you a hard time getting bank accounts so these are projects that are not doing anything illegal they're not doing anything that you know even the large portion of society consider for the unethical and thanks for still shutting them out so and also climb any privacy is important too right so this includes things like sea cash includes related projects in other similar spheres so this is still a you gotta decide of the space that I think definitely should not be discounted but aside from that right there's clearly use cases for votchin's that go beyond censorship resistance so descriptive case who here if they were a government regulator in North Korea and had the values of North Koreans would still would really care that much about sensory cryptokeys like there's plenty of out of more liquid things like realistic mind these are assets where you know you can't won and venue in the value might go up by a factor of two might go down by a factor of four just like steal a couple paintings over the artillery you'll be fine so the demand for sensor in crypto kitties as well so like what's the point of putting things like cryptic kitties onto the watching you know there wants to we have a specific study of a more general points that I like to make so back in 2015 I wrote this blog post where I basically argued against the concept of keywords apps and I basically said that the applications that have the highest value per user so basically the things that people really really really really need are probably already here yeah but the thing that's not here is this entire having much larger area of future your situation realistically delivers lost value per person but delivers value to a much larger set of people if you wants to kind of speculate about what some of those applications are well speculation on future usage great markets black markets then you go down to how you get international payments institutional payments its sumer payments games financial taps institutional stuff and then the list goes on and on and probably the bottom of the curve there is a lot of institutional things in there as well because the those are realistically the applications that didn't reach more than what doing okay so basically the question we have to ask is what is the value at that watch is our offer operated for the long tail so what an interesting kind of part of the value of Asia watching and what I think makes crypto key be psychologically attractive as opposed to just the records and somebody's server is the class of to Providence right so it's important to remember that watch hands did not invent digital assets and it's kind of digital even I kind of purely virtually issue digital money before I was in the crypto space I you can a played World of Warcraft for a while and the inside of World of Warcraft there was a called Warcraft gold World of Warcraft gold had zero transaction costs could be sent to someone anywhere in the world pretty much instantly had to equals zero instant settlement so basically look seems to be pretty much pretty much everything that we're going after so it's clearly in there there clearly isn't something sort of technically inherent in decentralization that makes those things possible but why is it better to have a crypto kitty as a record on the blockchain as opposed to a prett to PD as just my things stored into what you run by some guys somewhere in California so there's a very real sense in which if you have a crypto PD it's yours right if your ability to blow cabinets to trade it to give it to someone else is all not dependent on a central central issuer the crypto key bees continued existence is not dependent on the central issuer the essential issue were to not dilute them in a way that contradicts the rules of the system now in reality of course you can there's a bunch of caveats like for example crypto kitties are really easy to tell you could just keep on breeding them but that's part of the rules of the system and by the way in practice the application depends heavily on centralized components but no this is still a high diversion what group of concepts greatness so if you start going for version one to version two then we start thinking you can start to see how things like digital to look it's on the blog they can't actually kind of do a better job of reckless the feeling of ownership that you would get from something like physical baseball cards than anything managed on a centralized server ever again so this I mean I would claim that even this kind of fairly small thing is one example of an area we are blotches like genuine we do have a competitive advantage over centralized systems because centralized systems are just fundamentally not suitable of making commitments to maintain these kinds of properties basically forever interoperability so this is another I would claim a really nice benefit of watches in practice thank you so if today you decide I am going to make it nearly 2000 yeah that's wonderful new idea that no one has ever had before and I take the Cirrus II 20 of they issue it so this er seats money will immediately be usable inside walnuts so movies usable excited status it will be usable inside of that a basket will be usable inside but your hardware wallets it'll be usable Excitebike crypto it'll be usable inside by group to a classic HTA by ether wallet it'll be like basically every single kind of wallet in the ecosystem that supports crc buddies will support your thing it will immediately be treatable and decentralized exchanges so if you will immediately be able to for example just start you trading it on something like Yunus well it will immediately Beach balances will be trackable on these are scammers you will be able to immediately store your ERC 20 inside of multi-sig you'll be able to store it inside some kind of more fancy smart contract and in the future we'll have more smart culture in these cases that can be when a currency agnostic and you can have privacy solutions that are currency at Yonsei all right so a couple of piece ago there was that announcement of a stack which is this privacy solution that basically encrypts the values and transactions and they can find it together with a dime but really just by changing one line of code you can just take it and make it compatible with this but basically this is a very real benefit of just issuing a token as ERC 21b theory and watching as opposed to trying to be saved in an Excel spreadsheet now technically of course you could totally attend of create an ecosystem which is identical to a theory I mean which has all these interoperability benefits where the entire server was just run by Bob right but I would claim that there are there arts really technical reasons why that can't happen but there are good kind of social reasons why that hasn't and probably will not happen but it will get into one so I would argue that block chains are kind of a parallel networks applications what in parallel what open source did two applications on your computer right so you know the kind of 1990s the war basically was that you've had things like word and like all these derivatives and they basically created these kind of silos and then kept on trying to decipher each other's file formats and all of that but if you had instead had a free open-source software they used for open source software applications to deal with your files then you would basically you would not have you you will not have silos the applications would be able to just more easily interact with the same types of files so you could have open standards much more easily in all these other nice things and to a large extent the kind of open source and open standards mission had significant successes but there was also a big failure which is the kind of the basically the couple changed right so now we don't have proprietary software on their own computers we have proprietary software on other people's computers that we just connects to and oh by the way these other computers hold all your data so basically the idea is that what what chains can do is they can essentially allow you to create applications which hold data on this common usual platform that anyone can connects to and in doing so you can essentially gain similar kinds of benefits except in this time this time we're not just talking about data formats we're talking about state yeah I would claim that like first of all because we're talking into a state you do need this concept of whole lecture needs you need this sort of common thing that everyone agrees on and this is something which is not protectable reasons by primitive for social reasons just much more feasible to do on top of a decentralized base layer than on top of Bob's computer so another way to look at Cheng's as you can think of them as he kind of add-on to cryptography right so what is cryptography to cryptography lets you hide information I animals I can encrypt the message day now although now everyone except the recipie you can't see the message anymore with cryptography I can use digital signatures and I can proof that I made a message if I make a message you that message includes a hash of another message then I can prove I made the second message after I made the first message so there is a lot of things that you can do with cryptography and you can add on to this much more spread fancy stuff with zero knowledge proof but there are kind of things that cryptography does not like you to that block chains do you like you to so one of them is that you can prove my conveyed a message so he can prove that he made a message before some period of time and this is called proof of existence and you've been able to just do this the width I believe the big coin or the etherium Washington's for something like five years like you can prove that you did not make a message so he can prove that for example you did not authorize in operation to experience for ownership of your tails to some authority you can also prove that some set of messages is the entire set of messages that some set of participants that's of protocol intended subpoena so basically what was a watch instead of strictly exceed increase the extent to which you can assure people that you're not cheating them now the kinds of cheating that cryptography prevents and the kinds of cheating that block chains per heads are different right so cryptography it makes it prevents you from impersonating people it prevents thank you from the creep saying that you can to meeting someone thing and then like some other piece of data it prevents you from claiming false statements are true in certain cases in the case of watches that got basically the kinds of things that it prevents you from stealing he has first of all it they prevents you from mobili from censoring people right so if there is some application that's supposed to give everyone a chance to participate in some way then as someone running the application you can prove that you executed it in such a way that you didn't know I kind of just feel to take someone's a bit into account that's just one very simple example of this think of an auction ready you can clearly in an auction there's a lot of pieces where you benefit from just censoring one particular person's bid because well someone the second / highest bidder might want to win so what can be by committing data to the blockchain you can but basically more effectively convince people that you did not do that without requiring some extra central point of trust so example use cases one is a certificate revocation so basically it verifying that university degrees have done any I'd missed a Chanel occupants follow-up one are still valid and have not been revoked so this is one of the kind of bigger use cases of beer applying that some message has not been sent so this is verifying that something has not been revoked on key revocation so verifying that the actual present date process for verifying that some particular person is you actually it is the process of someone is claiming it is even if it's possible for this process to change itself over time so for example if you have some cryptographic see that you use to authenticate yourself and you want to be able to just changing your teeth and z1o these for the longer be valid then you can get a pre the cashew nut watching that basically enforce any kind of implements this concept of this is your activity and this is how you'll access it and implements the mechanism by which the account's has the ability to basically change its own access procedure so this is valid for things that are valuable for things like self sovereign identities this you know this valuable for there's many different kinds of at the stations like identity on the stations there is theoretically a pretty huge number of on non-financial use cases for the sort of stuff I mentioned auctions I also on polls or another interesting area where said censorship could potentially be problematic so let's try to delve a bit deeper into some of these social reasons that I'm telling that I mentioned for why I think it's easier to kind of get around it essentially it's been a network than it is to get an ecosystem around a centralized network or even a consortium network so in the game theory there is this fairly con well know the concepts call that common knowledge in the definition of common knowledge is this really wonderful recursive what the basically says X is common knowledge if everyone believes that X is true everyone believes that everyone else if the Nexus true everyone believes that everyone believes that everyone believes that X is true and so on and so forth right right so basically you can just kind of use the idea that X is true as part of an argument in any position in the arguments and it's like that that's a valid thing to do right so being able to and have have the knowledge on something is very valuable for coordination I would argue that because some block chains have these kind of theories universally shared trust assumptions so basically if long chains are secure because number one they're backed by cryptography and math and number two the parts that are not backed by cryptography and math are backed by economic incentives and well whose fear doesn't like money okay Wow it's still fewer people the belief of wizard people would relieve what your government uh-huh so like be it see uh who here believes that exactly zero people raise their hands what I asked who mr. Lussier does not believe that exactly zero people raise their hands what did I ask who doesn't like legend okay so I see it some about almost mor few people that words in the back row so we don't have quite have common knowledge but we you know how I think we're pretty close to come to knowledge so basically and you know because block chains to rely on these trust assumptions that are relatively easy to just have the it's are gonna be shared by very large groups of people including people in different industries different backgrounds different countries this makes it easier for communities to kind of gain common knowledge so not just all agree but all but all know that everyone else also agrees that these systems are trustworthy I would argue that boy chains have a much easier time achieving this than centralized systems so you might ask well what about consortium chains right so consortium chains definitely you have their valuable uses and especially now that public Jean Steel ability is still problematic in private and public chain but we can see and usability are still problematic there definitely are a lot of applications up they make much more sense for but there's you know we've heard a lot of play for the consortium chains but we've heard we've probably seen relatively little action right so you know what gives right ends so here is head of my theory for what kids right so first of all just getting a bunch of people together and putting together a consortium is socially expensive you have to fly around you have to talk to people you have to get people in one room you have to you have to pour that see you have to pour them blind after dinner when you're done after your time you have to it'll pay for people stupid limos there's always just the risk that people are just would be willing to join convincing Outsiders that joining a consortium is a fair deal is also socially expensive its socially difficult so one common pattern that I noticed that at least a couple of a consortium projects that eventually just said I'd give up for Z with plasma it was basically that they start off by saying we want to be a consortium chin and then very quickly discover one one partner some one big company that just says oh this sounds really interesting sure will be your first user of Leggett's iridium and you know will get a second partner but then start talking to a third or fourth partner and the third fourth partners they have a hard time actually signing on because well it's difficult to convince them that your deal creating a system where they actually will be treated fairly it's not just something that's done for the first partners interests and basically they actually have a hard time scaling up beyond one the two participants and going up to twenty or thirty right if you're the first that you have kind of a lot of de facto power you get a lot of public attention out of it and it's nice but for the fifth or the tenth member there is actually relatively little interest in joining also getting Outsiders so people who are not part of your consortium so trust your consortium is also something that's socially expensive so what that basically means is well sure you know theoretically there's these institutions and people trust them but then one guy on the internet brings up that oh you know these are the same financial institutions that are involved in some LIBOR thing blah blah blah and so I can't trust them and then you have a you have a harder time arguing against it and the whole thing just kind of even like even if you believe in trust and it's still kind of more difficult to have the conversation it just gets to the point where everyone agrees because the thing so basically what what one of these consortium chain projects to eventually did is they said well we've tried doing this for one year we've tried doing this for two years we give up and we're basically just going to build some public chain based thing the others you know we're going to throw it up and watch it you know we'll help other people get on and other people are definitely free to get on and if other people want to get on well they can just look at the code they can basically just verify for themselves that this is something that they do that is going to treat them in the same way as they treated the first people to join and is just generally something fear to participate in now in so far the one disclaimer I have to give is of course there are basically serial plasma projects that are seeing a large number of users but you know this is kind of the pitch that I think the space is testing for at least the next couple of years so in other things to note is that I think first of all I think the need for compromises between centralization and decentralization is real and I definitely think that you know even though there are concrete places where decentralization is very useful and valuable it's also the case that the centralization provides a lot of efficiency in terms of reducing transaction costs reducing latency optimizing the hell out of things and so on and so forth and so in many cases you are probably going to wants to have compromises between the two extremes but aside from consortium jams I would say there are other kinds of compromises that institutional users should find palatable in just as a kind of a few different examples I mean first of all there's plasma so plasma basically allows you to create even a centralized system which publishes proofs into a watching and does so in such a way that the actual load on the blockchain is very low but you get this guarantee that if the centralized system screws up you as a user would still be able to basically get your money out by and healing to the public watching as a shoe now if your obligation is not financial so you don't need a kind of exit game to determine who gets what assets and all you care about is using one chance just to prove that something is true then you can use basically plausible with a Mexican so what this means is that you just published in vienna in myrtle trees you publish your Burkle research in and if you wants to show prove to someone that some message was not published then what you do is you basically just literally send them your entire kind of sub chain your entire set of myrtle tree data and they'll be able to see that oh in the set of her poetry data that i received there was nothing there wasn't a lot and a message of this type that i'm looking for and they can also check the watching another watchi and i get i can tell that the purple tree is that someone gave to me it actually contained all of them were all words that was published in the chain so basically what this kind of two-step proving algorithm like where step one you check the chain and you make sure you got the entire list of roots and then step two you go through the trees check the trees correspond to the roots and she had none of the trees have some piece of dietrich data that you're looking for you actually can get this assurance that says that some transaction of some particular type did not happen now there are ways to accelerate this much further vines using mobile watch chains together with things like Starks but this is a conversation for another time because Starks are very spook and complicated but also really great fun aside from myrtle trees you also have channels right so channels are basically are a I know you can think of it a lot like between two parties we are updates to the mini chain between two parties can happen instantly and that they only needs to publish the result of their interaction at the end as they could have a thousand interactions between the two but then as long as they agree on what the result is nothing actually needs to go unchanged yeah this is another kind of scalability technique and it's so I would say also a very useful one and it was also interesting to see that the enterprise space basically independently rediscovered something very simple or very similar whether in when they said oh we wants to have watches where you know you have two different where you can make kind of sub watch change between two parties where only the two parties see the data and no one else needs to be bothered with the data well if that's what you want some channels are basically exactly with that great so and then the last compromise is one that will become more interesting when public watch scenes become more scalable yes to just be willing to tell all your data on a chain but you encrypted so only a few people that need to see the data can see the data or instead of encrypting it you publish zero knowledge proof to the data on chin so combining together at a more scalable audience and cryptography so there are you know clearly if kind of a lot more things that theoretically can be doubled functions and I would argue a lot more systems that should use watching smart contracts kind of this entire ecosystem in some way or another now the really important question we need to ask here is what technical steps do we need to go through so who here thinks the the usability problem with cryptocurrency wallets has been solved oh okay um what species is a UK government controlled by what species is that UK cover that's good okay so there's clearly a lot of work to do right and ultimately in order for public watchings to actually really and you can kind of see this relationship in any kind of old mathematical model which I don't even want to call a mathematical model because it's just a stupid chart okay but basically you know you have this graph we are the y-axis is like is the amount of value that an application provides per user and the x-axis is how many users now if there is a very high bar to the difficulty of usage of a blockchain the only applications of a blockchain that will exist all of the applications that can get over the usability column and so today the usability hub is high and because the usability hub is high the number of users that benefit from the blockchain enough to get over the usability hump it is realistically also fairly low now if we can get the usability health much lower then we can greatly increase the amount of usage and the total from the usage that becomes feasible tomorrow so what exactly is the difference between the high bar of the bulbs right like what kind of things do we need to what do we actually need to focus on if we wants to try to push the bars out work so now interestingly enough this list is like basically eight because that can be the same that's the list that I've been trying out for the last two to three years which on the one hand might seem like there's no progress but in reality there's been a huge amount of progress that's just these problems are all very hard and some extent some of them are never going to be solved we can only just improve things so scalability 15 transactions per second so I think as I mentioned before I believe twelve transactions per second is that that would how many transactions a second who produces and I believe them in Southeast Asia you know they have this wonderful agreement between uber and grab and so now you can see super anymore you have to use grab so grab a few more transactions per second what Satan wants to use your watch-chain for something other than participating in one of the two largest ride-sharing monopolists if we decided to all go unchanged well no more space so clearly blockchains are just fundamentally scalability wise like it's not even a horizontal barrier it's literally a vertical wall that just prevents usage from going any higher yeah so how do we solve this well in the short term state channels plasma Merkle trees for everything mizuki start roll ups threshold signatures bla bla bla like a lot of the same buzzwords as we've heard for the last two years but the water there has been a huge amount of progress in the last one and a half years right so maybe one and a half years ago speech in those on etherium we're most theoretical and now there are multiple actual real-life applications that are using them a few months ago plasma was entirely theoretical now plus plasma is not quite life but you know there's still want the there are proof of proof of concepts right and you know even a couple of weeks ago there was this one produces company called the matter and I producing a positive this 0.018 I tried most Welling 0.018 then it told me that it had to pay 0.05 mm security deposit and then I had to wait for two weeks and then I think I was either I was able to actually not sure if I was able to find other points but in it so still early days but no there's still a lot of progress with it yeah more progress that is being made fairly quickly they're saying you have proof of concept of plasma prime that which is a and upgrades a plasma cash which is itself an upgrade to plasma that is being kind of quietly but very actively worked on so it's an area which is like moving forward very quickly now in the long term of course there is shorting and now basically the like come when described shorting well if the current etherium is you will be presentation sharding is like you would seeking over every single room of Imperial College and listening to Justin giving the presentation and using uh using the livestream yeah if you want to move between the grooves you can just like what from one to the other so way more scalability but you know more technical challenges and it does kind of fundamentally change how the system works now user experience so user experience comes at the multiple leaders right so there's wallets so there are things that we can do to make wallets have better user experience just by improving wallets by themselves now there are also things that we can do it later one so here has had the experience where they sent a transaction on material and they expected it to get included fairly quickly but then some for some reason it just did not get included at all over something like okay now it turns out that this problem is largely solvable with like some fairly small layer ones weeks so one thing that we can do is we can obviously just reduce the block time and we can make the block size more constant and that's something that's coming for group of states another thing that we can do is we can make changes to the future so we can make changes to the theme or get that basically remove the need to have complex the estimation policies aims but make it much easier for wallets to just automatically know is optimal or that they know is going to get included into the next block and that is the cheapest that they could possibly pay so I am only happy blog post on this so if you look up I think resource price price and settle with my name and there is a speed 130 pH paper where pages 19 to 20 describe how it works but like it's here seems very cool and as you catch seems interested in integrating it so it's one of those things I'm looking forward to and what basically if this happens then you know you won't have to worry anymore about do I set my gas to be a little medium or high did I overpay did I accidentally underpaid it do I have to wait much longer so there are things that we can do to increase user experience considerably also security right so what exactly is the point of having a reinforced steel door on your home when the windows over basically not much of a point right well okay fine the window is for the lizard people can come in but the weight here basically is that a wall chains are in some respects extremely secure if the cryptography were well the if the cryptography works which it seems like it works and if you can keep your private key and you can make sure your private key doesn't get lost or stolen then your money is like completely secure problem is people have a hard time keeping track of their private keys and making sure their private key is don't get lost or stolen so this is a security challenge and it is a what I call a user experience of security challenge it's something that this piece needs to solve security of smart contracts code so also a big problem one that I think is slowly improving and I feel like the number of like terrible smart contract books has been a considerably going down over time and I think part of that is just us knowing what the cotton cluster bugs are a part of that is just us being more careful in a bunch of ways part of that is better tools part of that is I love languages so that both includes fight for it includes the improvements so would it be better happened over the last year so and then also a formal verification is starting to come in so as you miss lockness a fairly recent unity centralized exchange did a partial formal verification of kind of the main function that runs some a lot of the tweeting and their support contracts so there's a lot of progress happening right so what's the purpose of all this well if we can equality as much more scalable then supplying to the ends we can reduce transaction costs to the points we are instead of being four five cents for a transaction we would pay zero point two zero five cents in routine px zero point zero five cents even if the number of users increases by factor 100 if we can sole user experience problems then regular people will be more able and inclined to actually use this software and they will be able to actually use it any way that does not lead to some large chance per year of them losing all their money so it is a big deal right if you know back when I joined the crypto space and something like 2011 in 2012 one of the kind of really hot things they complained about was a negative interest rates and the 0 since whisperer executive interest rate what percentage er how terrible but then with cryptocurrency as well there is for the average person more than a 1% chance that you who is all your money of anyone given here so this is really a practical improvement well not yet but yeah this is something that we did everyone and finally you know if we could improve on security than even less risk that people always all their money then we can kind of push down this bar of usage and we can meet watch hands absolutely usable to a much larger set of people and we can actually realize he is kind of more complicated and dangerous than benefits that the watching and even the public watching space specifically really does

    oh I'm here to talk about decentralization and I'm sure what a lot of people have heard about blog chains I'm sure people have heard about Bitcoin if heard about aetherium but what I wanted to do is first of all put some of these ideas into context and talk about the different kinds of decentralization that we have these ends the reasons why decentralization is a good idea the reason why different kinds of decentralization make sense in some areas why different kinds of decentralization don't make sense in other areas and then start to see how these ideas and the benefits that you can get from these ideas make sense particularly in the energy industry so first of all I wanted to point out that decentralization in general is not a new idea right I mean we've had human civilization for over 10,000 years and over the last 10,000 years lots of different we've had lots of instances of centralized things centralized systems centralized companies centralized governments centralized cities and we've had lots of instant instances of decentralized things and I mean these are just some instances of decentralized applications in the software industry in the last 15 years but really it's also important to point out that you know even before we've had computers even before we've had IT you know we've had various various instances of decentralized economies decentralized ways of interacting so if you just look at one particular example just look at the insurance industry for example you know right now we have large insurance companies and if you have insurance you generally have insurance be either because of some national government program or because if you're buying a service from some insurance company that sells insurance as a product to very large numbers of people but the way that the insurance industry started in many cases actually was you know a groups of people coming together and saying okay we each have a ship and if any one of our ships sinks or gets captured by a pirate then we all agree to cover each other's costs so you know decentralized models in is something that's existed for quite a while right now if we look at the software industry in particular you know we've had BitTorrent is just one example you know we've had decentralized networks for sending files from one computer to another if you look at email it's in in some ways it's a semi decentralized protocol you know you can access email through Gmail or through you know Microsoft's email or through some other email service or theoretically if you really wanted to you could set up your own server um we've you know if you wants to download some file then BitTorrent is one great way to do that and you know it's in fact we've even you know it's something that a lot of software developers even use as a primary way of distributing data that they produce to their users right so if you use open source software packages generally the developers don't even have the resources to actually set up and maintain the infrastructure to centrally upload and send their software to tens of millions of users and a lot of the time they even use decentralized networks as a way of solving the problem you know if anyone's ever downloaded Ubuntu you might you know that you know the they really try and push you toward using a decentralized network and basically instead of downloading the software from them downloading the software from your peers you know your users become part of your network and you know even at the same time as they download the software they help kind of pass the software along to their friends so that's also a model that a lot of major game gaming about providers use to a distribute patches there should be updates to their games to their users it's a paradigm that gets used quite a bit increasingly for messaging for storing files so it's something that you know has already been used for quite a while right now 2009 satoshi nakamoto came up with the idea behind Bitcoin and here no finally he's come up with a peer-to-peer electronic cash system right so you know computer scientists cypherpunks lots of people have been interested in these ideas of decentralizing things for quite a while but for the one one major application that they've had a really hard time with is actually money right so you know they figured out how to do decentralized messaging figured out how to send files but currency is this one application that for reason something I'm going to get into ended up taking them quite a long time so you know back in the 1980s back in the 1990s there have been various forms of kind of cryptographic Emani but you know coming up with a version that doesn't rely on one central party to kind of manage the whole system actually proved to be quite challenging so in theory am that's the project that I'm working on and the goal basically is to take the ideas behind Bitcoin the technology the the blockchain and try and make it more generalized there I try to come up with a kind of architecture that you can use to build decentralized applications in a very general sense so you know it's the it's an area that's fairly rapidly moving forward right but it's important to also ask a question what is decentralization and you know why do we want it what are the benefits what are we trying to get out of this right so there have been lots of people trying to define the word in lots of people trying to kind of define decentralize defined distributed defined kind of what the difference between the two is in my opinion most people that are trying to do this tends to not come up with particularly good classifications and you know basically there's probably more people who think decentralized and distributed or synonyms and there are people who think there's who agree on any particular way of categorizing the difference so I'm probably going to go straight into my own classification which i think is better than everyone else's and I generally break down the centralization into three parts right so I talked about first of all Orkut actual decentralization which basically means is it one physical system or is it many physical systems you know is does everything depends on one particular computer one particular root server one particular kind of central architecture for managing things or is it kind of spread out across many computers or many systems where you know if you know even a small portion if any of them go offline or get hacks the rest of the system still keeps working the next kind of decentralization is political decentralization right so the idea here basically is it's not just about the physical architecture the physical distribution it's about control you know if the system is your protocol controlled by one person one entity or is it controlled by kind of everyone together the third kind of decentralization is logical decentralization so this basically means is it what is the system that you're creating does it kind of look like one single thing so it doesn't create a doesn't create a singleton it doesn't create kind of one single object or doesn't work more like an amorphous swarm you know the third one is kind of a bit harder to understand in many cases but you know I'll give a few examples and hopefully don't want to start to become clear so I usually I mean I tend to make this kind of chart and you know you can come up with various different combinations of this some of these combinations are harder to get than other combinations so if we one just one quick example is if you look at let's say a direct democracy then you know chances it's architectural we centralized because you have one Parliament we're in it or you have you know a lot of central government buildings where decisions are being made you have in police you have military but at the same time it's more politically decentralized because even though there are kind of a few chambers there's still the actual decision-making power is still fairly widely spread among large groups of people it's also logically centralized because there is one government kind of create one set of laws now if you walk on the other extreme look at something like the English language it's politically decentralized no one controls it it's architectural a decentralized there is kind of no one single place where it's taught there's no one single place where it gets created and it's also logically decentralized and what I mean by that is you know the English language spoken by people in one part of the world and the English language spoken and in other parts of the world may well actually be different right so you know it's you know you you could easily have different even the English speakers actually disagree on you know what a few words on the meanings of a few words on how they use a few words but even still what roughly works right but meanwhile in other cases in all the blockchain you have something which has architectural we decentralized politically decentralized but it is logically centralized and I would argue that actually has benefits right so you know quite a lot of the time when people talk about block chains they actually talk about the benefits of kind of having everything be in a single database instead of having you know every single Bank or every single institution have their own database and then having some very complex and very inefficient processes for reconciling between them so I would argue logical centralization in many cases actually does have benefits right so now I personally believe that you know these kinds of decentralization have benefits in various different situations and sometimes you might want logical decentralization sometimes you might want logical centralization and sometimes a blockchain isn't necessarily the right tool for you but you know in some cases it is and in those cases where it is I hope we can kind of work together and figure out what is the best way and the best place to use them so why decentralize is the next question and here I have another kind of categorization and I split it up into a few different reasons right so one reason is just simple efficiency so in some cases making a system be decentralized actually just is the most efficient way to build it you know in some cases you've wants to have decentralized production because your customers are decentralized and you wants to have you know one Purdue producer being closed close to every possible set of customers right you know you you want the physical distribution of let's say restaurants is something that really obviously should be decentralized because if all the restaurants were in one city then everyone would have to drive 500 kilometers every time they want to go to a restaurant so that's just a one trivial example where decentralization does make things more efficient right now there are also other reasons so for example spare capacity considerations you know when people talk about the efficiencies that you can get with things like uber and airbnb you know what are they talking about there are people who already have their own cars they have people who already have their own you know houses and they have kind of resort resources that they're only using some of the time right they have kind of unused spare capacity you know the idea is that you can get kind of extra efficiencies because instead of having to build new infrastructure specifically for the purpose of you know renting it out for for a day or giving people taxi rides you can kind of use spare capacity in infrastructure that already exists right so this is one set of advantages in other set of advantages has to do with fault tolerance so you know decentralized systems or any system has some risk of breaking but decentralized systems are also like way to break there isn't kind of one single thing where if the one single thing breaks then the entire internet goes down then a third argument is attack resistance right so with attack resistance it's basically a matter of you know thinking how hard is it to take this to bring a system down how hard is it to cause the system to misbehave and you know basically the idea is that if you try and build systems that have kind of very expensive sensors then even if you spend a hundred times more resources making a making your Center it's it's not going to take a hundred times more resources to attack right look basically the more you kind of can bring component different components together into one highly centralized thing in fact the easier it is to cause that system to break the easier it is to disrupt it and if you want to build something that's stable then you actually want to try to you're going to distribute it out among as many different components as possible now another argument is collusion resistance so this is one where political decentralization really starts coming to the forefront and basically it's a way that I think about it is as a way of making it it's about making it more difficult for one particular subgroup of a community or of a market or of an ecosystem to come together and act in its own benefit at everyone else's expense right so the simplest example is you know it's you know you you really wants to avoid having monopolies right because you know if you have a monopoly then you know everyone who owns the monopolies obey or or will be able to kind of raise prices get it get some higher profits but from the point of view of the ecosystem from the point of view of the community in general you know prices go up there's lots of activities that really should be possible but stop being possible because because prices go higher and it's generally bad for the economy now if you go in monopolies can do lots of things other than raising prices and some of them in the long term might even be more dangerous and we can go into that a bit too right so these are some of the reasons why decentralized systems make sense and I mean I think these are a lot of these are reasons that people people here should be able to relate to right so from the point of view of efficiency I mean you know people who are now I personally admit I do not know enough about the solar industry to be able to kind of personally endorse this article but you know this is something that people are talking about people it this is something that you see er people thinking about a lot this idea that forms of energy production like solar and wind are kind of more naturally more become more efficient if you decentralize them right become more efficient if you create this ecosystem where instead of relying on a few large firms to provide all the electricity you basically what people put solar solar panels on the rooftops put windmills on the rooftops and create this economy where not only do you have millions of consumers but you also have millions of producers so Airbnb for cloud storage so this is and I brought up or the kind of uber and airbnb SPR capacity arguments earlier and this is something that people are working to try to do in other industries as well right so there's a lot of kind of block chain based decentralized storage or decentralized computation startups and they're basically trying to kind of leverage their capacity in the same way as well in other natural use case is content delivery networks so you know if you as a user try to access a website where is the computer that's serving the website to you you know the closer's Aria you can find the computer a server to yourself the faster you're gonna get the site so that's one area where decentralization makes sense as well so that's why that's one example now from the point of view of fault tolerance here's a interesting article from a few years ago and basically what this is saying is that if you look at the just the decisions made by the United States Supreme Court and if you look at the citations that they make for every time you know they have a link and you try to follow the link forty-nine percent of the time that link is broken now why is the like broken basically because the link the way that linking to data on the internet works is that it's a fundamentally centralized paradigm right it's a paradigm where you know the first part of the link says what website you have to go to and basically what server you talk to and the second part of the link says what do you ask them right so you know a problem is what if the original server goes down right you know chances are if you write something five years later you might forget about it or you might put a put it up on some blogging platform in five years later the blogging platform shuts down and what do you do that so there are you know one of the companies I kind of very briefly mentioned earlier on is ipfs and what they're trying to do as they are trying to make a more decentralized standard for this where instead of linking to a piece of data by which particular server is supposed to host it you would link to a piece of data base by making a hash making a cryptographic pointer to what does that specific piece of data is and as long as there is at least one computer on the internet that hosts it as long as there is one computer on the internet somewhere that has the data and that's what I'm gonna send it to you you will be able to get the data back right so this is one practical example of how decentralization and even specifically even how political decentralization to can get you fault tolerance power outages right so power outages right now is one example of how centralization can weaken will need fertility as well now attack resistance so from attack resistance another example how of one of the kind of major dangers of centralization and here you know basically this is something that happens about five years ago and this is about another piece of our internet infrastructure that ended up being quite centralized and basically it's a certificate authorities right so it's the company is that you know if you know if you access some meat your website like whether it's Google or whether it's some means your bank you know you have if you access them through HTTPS you get that kind of green walk in your browser that says that you know this this actually is that website and it's not some hacker that managed a kind of man in the middle of your connection well you know the companies that actually provide the kind of certificates to public key is that make that system work or the one of those companies got hacked a few years ago and basically a huge number of websites suddenly became vulnerable right so this is another thing that there's quite a lot of people that are looking to see if they can decentralize here's another instance of idea of centralization being dangerous so you know this is actually one very high-profile example but there have been quite a few examples of this probably over the last three or four years in general when you have points of centralization points of centralization become points of central data collection and a point of central data collection is something that can get attacked and they can lead to very large data leaks very easily you know right now we have data leaks almost everywhere you know basically if you use some online service you can expect with high probability that anything you do inside of that service will at some point at some point years from now get leaked and you know what the world will have access to it so it's basically over here you know we have this was a particularly high-profile example because this website basically was that a kind of a dating site for people to have affairs and you can expect that if people have affairs in what there are fears to be kept private and the site got hacked and to Val you know a few million people got very nasty surprises so this now it's also I think importance to keep in mind that there's two kinds of costs to failures of centralized systems one of them is the C is kind of the scene which is basically what you know security law says faults that happen to you to existing over centralization in the other kind of cost that I want to bring up is the unseen so what do I mean by the unseen basically unrealized gains efficiency gains that do not happen because people are afraid of upgrading to network enabled technology is basically because these network enable technologies right now we're insecure because right now they're not centralized one very simple example online voting you know if I mean practically speaking the fact that in the 21st century we still use pen and paper to vote in some cases it's archaic and it's and harder I'd argue it's highly inefficient and to a 21st century person like me it's pathetic but on the other hand you see how you know if you're you know a lot of the reasons why people are afraid of switching to a more electronic version is precisely because they're afraid of a huge number of very real security risks right so look that's just one example of what I would call the kind of the unseen costs of bad cybersecurity so collusion resistance I mean basically you know monopolies right monopolies are bad so the ways that monopolies are bad tend to be fairly subtle as well so you know you have one of the main kind of issues that you have is sort of bait and switch attacks where people and entrepreneurs you know people businesses people end up making themselves dependent on one particular centralized provider and then the way that that centralized provider works just suddenly ends up switching on you right so people make ups make startups that are based around Twitter api's and then Twitter changes their policies and your business model has gone overnight so one solution to all these problems is Federation right so you can build protocols where instead of relying on one particular centralized provider you would row based you would have a protocol where you could rely on you could rely on a set of centralized providers and the idea basically would be that you know you anyone would be able to set up one of these servers and anyone could use which server they they personally want and people that use different servers will be able to talk to each other now one of the problems of this is that it's a kind of market equilibrium that's proved to be very hard to sustain basically because as soon as there is any dominant provider they're gonna have the incentive to embrace extended extinguish right they're gonna have the incentive to start making proprietary extensions to make make themselves incompatible with everyone else and basically try and turn the whole thing back into a centralized system again another problem is that in general in federated people have tried making federated protocols so the diaspora protocol is meant to be a federated social network a federated alternative to Facebook and what ended up happening is that the the largest server that that's basic that people set up so the largest server the earth join diaspora org ended up getting about a 50% mortgage here right so it's Federation is a solution that does have lots of challenges now fully decentralized open protocols is one of those kind of once one other solution that makes might make more sense and blockchains are one example in abortions don't rely on people kind of choosing one particular server walk chains actually do rely on our kind of protocols that work without any one particular centralized in to meet you know intermediary being necessary so how do these ideas fit into the energy industry right so first of all you have to think about what it is that you're trying to decentralize so in general I mean you have production of energy and you know who is producing the energy whether it's coal nuclear solar wind you know it's produced by somebody and the producers might be centralized you might be decentralized distribution so the wires basically and I already I mean I would also add to the distribution things like energy storage in infrastructure source authentication so you know some people care about whether or not their energy is green people tear about whether or not there might care about whether or not their energy is financing any nasty dictators and also market mechanisms right so basically allocation and incentivization so these are all things that you might think about none of the Oh being an areas where decentralization might make sense now the next question is where block chains actually makes sense right so block chains seem like they're generally a very good infrastructure for building markets but I think we can also think about source authentication you know we can also think about supply chain interacting thinking about support verification and those kinds of use cases as well so markets are interesting because in some ways markets even as they are are already a kind of incentivize distributed computation algorithm right so there are sort of areas where the decentralized computation is in some kind of very implicit sense happening now but you know the question is can we actually make can we kind of build on this and build decentralized market infrastructures that are even better so markets in general are stateful in the sense that you know they are kind of fairly complex infrastructures where a fairly complex mechanisms that often do have kind of some notion of internal state have to remember kind of some notion of internal information so if the centralization makes sense then blockchains may well be part of the solution right so how could you centralization help I mean one area where it might help is fairness so in market designs improving that these market designs are fair that's sixty years worth of math game theory all sorts of fairly complicated research but what block chains can do is they can prove that the algorithm that people think is being used is the algorithm that actually is being executed also privacy preservation so in general points of centralization become points of central data collection and in general block chains don't provide privacy by themselves but if you combine them with strong cryptography and with decentralization as a holistic principle then you can create architectures that do do a much better job of preserving privacy now why preserve privacy yeah I mean I think it's important to kind of underscores points that privacy isn't just about big brother paranoia like privacy is also a Creole is kind of a critical requirement for incentive compatibility of many classes of mechanisms right so like it's in many cases a key part of making sure that markets work so with so with that I wanted to say thank you and look forward to seeing what everyone here is going to come up with

  - Video: "Vitalik Buterin - Ethereum Foundation Keynote Talk at @ETH Seoul "Ideas for things worth building""
    good morning has the morning actually been good okay great uh so since your morning is good like let's talk about building stuff uh so things that so this is just to kind of give a few different categories of ideas that i think are really worthwhile for people to start building and to start like really concretely working on like right now and so in general i think like a lot of things have changed in the uh crypto space and in the ethereum and the development world in particular in the last two years like a lot of uh technologies that were like really just like thoughts and ideas and theories uh two years ago have like slowly become very real um over the last couple of years and in in a few voices recently like i've talked about what some of those changes are right like one is the fact that you know we have roll ups we have scaling uh things are getting cheaper again uh so a lot of applications are just much more economically viable than they were one or two years ago and so you know when before like you might even say well maybe d5 is the only thing that makes sense to build because defy is the only thing where people are willing to pay like 12 dollars a transaction well now you know transactions are cost much less than 12 dollars and rollups are getting better every day so there's a lot of other things that you can build as well right um another really big and really important thing that's been happening over the last five years is the growth of zero knowledge technology right so like i actually think that zk snarks might be like almost or even equally as important to the kind of you know privacy openness and you know freedom kind of alternative decentralized web tech movement as blockchains are like they're actually extremely powerful tools they're extremely effective at giving us privacy giving us scalability and and at the same time preserving security which is a similar thing to what blockchains are trying to do right and in some ways like zero knowledge proofs and blockchains are actually very good complements for each other right because blockchains give you a lot of security but in exchange they sacrifice privacy and they sacrifice scalability ziki snarks give you back privacy and they can give you back scalability um so build ck apps right uh basically i think we've now gotten to the point where the tools for building a lot of zika snark applications are just getting better and better every year um the protocols are getting better and better our ability to prove things like make proofs that you can actually prove on a computer in a reasonable amount of time is getting better and better i remember in 2016 when the first version of z cash launched it took like more than one minute to generate a signature and today like all of these applications they can generate proofs in like somewhere sometimes three seconds sometimes like less than one second depending on you know what technology you're using so build zero knowledge applications um zero knowledge applications are i think uh great for uh both uh privacy and uh scalability um right so um here like i have this a link to a blog post if you just uh if you just go to vitalik.ca or orvitalic.ethe.link either one i mean you just like scroll down the list um i wrote this post about one or two months ago or just talk about some of the ways that you can use your knowledge proofs uh to actually build uh many kinds of applications that uh preserve privacy and there's also a lot of applications obviously of your knowledge proofs for scalability right so zk roll ups are a great example and there's a bunch of teams building ziki roll-ups for the evm which i think is great um privacy i think is still a bit less explored than scalability actually so just like some interesting examples of uh privacy preserving applications that uh might make sense to work on um privacy preserving like proof of humanity or privacy preserving proof of pope like basically like in ethereum we have we're starting to have like more and more of these protocols where they're basically issuing like some kind of attestation to like um at different like specific addresses to say something about the person who controls that address right so the proof of humanity protocol for example it's a protocol um where if you you have to sign up and there's like a dow that verifies the submissions and if it accepts you then it basically says like this address corresponds to some unique human right so it's not a bot it's not like one person having five thousand accounts it's like one specific person that has one account and if you do if you have proof of humanity as an ingredient then like you can start building a lot more powerful um applications you have like a lot of a lot more room to decide like what kinds of things you'll be building right so for example you could build an airdrop where instead of like doing an airdrop just based on um you know how like how many coins does someone have how many transactions have someone sent you can like say i'm going to actually give like 15 coins to every single human right um you know you could do like even nft sales in a way that's more fair um you can do a sale uh just create market mechanisms that try to be like more fair to individual people in some way um i'll talk about this later but like there's also um ways to make uh decentralized governance more fair if you try to like count humans instead of just counting coins um and privacy preserving proof of pope so pope the proof of attendance protocol is a protocol that basically lets you say this address belongs to someone who actually participated at some event right so like i went to you know a conference in argentina last year and i got a pope for it right so there is a pope that that that god given out to everyone who visited this conference in argentina and so you don't just know that this person is a human but you you actually know like what kind of communities they're part of and like what a different no how much have they participated in like in different kinds of communities right so you get more of this kind of information now one of the big challenges with both of these protocols is privacy right like you're basically revealing to the anyone who can read the blockchain like who you are um and this is a big privacy risk but at the same time like i think there's a lot of really important things that we can gain from having these protocols and so the challenge is like how do we get the benefits without the costs right and zero knowledge proofs could actually help a lot here right like with zero knowledge proofs you could do something like prove that you are a unique human without revealing which human you are um you could prove that you have a pope and that you attended like five events from a particular list without revealing like which events you attend specifically attended and without revealing like what your actual identity is so a lot of interesting applications there um zk negative reputation uh so this is actually one of the sort of more advanced um examples in this post that i wrote basically the idea is to have a reputation system where you can make attestations that are not just positive but also negative um so you'll be able to prove things like you know i have like i participated in some decentralized social media platform and i made these posts that got upvoted but i did not but i also did not get down voted or like i also did not like have did not get flagged for abuse uh so you can do like all of these things but at the same time also preserve people's privacy right um zero knowledge and npc data marketplaces this is um interesting like i think a lot of people have been interested in this idea of like creating like more fair market voices for data um and yeah no there's applications of this in healthcare there's applications of this and like a lot of different spaces but there the problem is that like it's not just a blockchain problem right because you are trying to solve a trust problem but the trust problem you're trying to solve is not just the kind of trust problem that a blockchain solves you're also trying to solve a problem of privacy right a problem of like i want to give a little thing about a little piece of data about myself but i don't want to give more data than that i mean ideally like he wants to even give data that contributes to like say someone's machine learning model without actually like giving them giving them the data directly right and if he wants to do those kinds of things then you need a different kind of cryptography called multiplayer multi-party computation so combine zero knowledge proofs and multi-party computation try to create better data marketplaces i mean this is a very advanced topic but i think like this is the frontier and there's a lot of exciting things that you can build here so those are just a few examples of things that you can build with zero knowledge stuff i mean i think building with your knowledge tech is still it is still advanced but it's getting less and less advanced and the tools are becoming more accessible with every year so i still you know encourage people to really look at the tech and really consider like even now using uh using it to build something uh soulbound tokens uh so this is um something that um a couple of um uh articles one that i published myself and uh a more recent paper that i co-authored about a month ago like basically the idea is of using tokens that are non-transferable right uh so the basic idea here is that like you want to be have tokens that represents like say that you actually are a member of some community that you actually like learn like a prove that you know that you know something that you have some experience you proved that you completed some challenge you want to like prove that different things about yourself but you wants to prove that like actually you were the one who did those things and you did not just like buy a token from someone else for fifty dollars and so basically making tokens that are like non-transferable so pope is um actually a good example of this right now pope tokens like they are transferable in that like they are erc721s and you can send them to someone else if you want to but like you can look on the blockchain and see right like has this pope actually been transferred um and if you like you can tweet popes that are still in their original address and and pokes that have been transferred uh differently right um and i'm basically expecting that these kinds of things are going to become used for a lot like a lot more different kinds of uh projects uh so and i think there are a lot of applications of this right so one that i mentioned is what we call soul drops like basically air drops where in order to qualify for the air drop like you you try to use some of this like on-chain information to actually figure out like who is in the community that you want to airdrop to right like a lot of different projects he wants to airdrop but one of the challenges that they always face is like if you airdrop then sometimes the airdrop just gets farmed by vcs right and vc is just create a hundred thousand accounts uh sometimes uh the air drop you just give it to random people and someone creates like a really efficient app where everyone can just like go and dump their airdrop on unit swap for 32 bucks and everyone does that and like you know you have just lost a lot of money uh so what you want to do is like i think you want to distribute your token supply you don't want to have this kind of you know plutocratic dystopia where like seven people and vc funds control have to supply but you also want to like actually give the supply out to people who are actually in your community right and so how do you tell like in a very verifiable kind of automatic way that it gives you like some of you know what we call credible neutrality some ability to like actually prove to the public that you were fair in how you allocated it and that you're not like quietly giving lots of coins to yourself um soulbound tokens might actually be a very powerful tool for doing this right so proof of humanity you can like limit to individual people um you could even like you know do interesting things with proof of humanity like you could make a sort of fair ico where if you want to uh let's say sell the you could buy your first token for one dollar but then buying your second token cost two dollars buying your third token costs three dollars and so the more tokens you buy the higher the price of each one goes right so there's like different ways to try to create these mechanisms to sort of make them you know less plutocratic and more fair um and things like proof of humanity could be a big part of it um proof of attendance protocol can be good and similar ideas can be good for not just checking like who is a human but also checking like who is actually a member of a particular community um and i think there's a lot of like good ideas here but there is a lot of room still to actually build the infrastructure to make it really easy to do these kinds of things so i think this is like you know another challenge for developers like try to actually build more of these tools um another interesting one is uh in this concept of like soul bound token gated community forums right so like imagine a private chat where it's basically things that are set in the chat they don't get automatically broadcasted to everyone but they can you know it isn't like just a couple of people who decide who gets in and who gets kicked out instead like say you have a dow um and that dao issues tokens and uh even like based on some measurement of whether or not you're in a particular community um that determines whether whether or not you can get in so this i mean obviously like soul bound tokens and zero knowledge i think like they're not separate and i there are really important synergies between them and the reason why there are really important synergies i think is obvious right because like there's a lot of really cool things that you can do just by having the ability to like know more things about the people behind the addresses that you're interacting with and being able to say like this person is from this community this person is not this person is a you know core developer of of uh this project um and uh you know this person has um you know one ethereum address but actually he is he's mostly involved in some completely separate project um in like being able to distinguish those things but the more you gain that ability the more you're like breaking people's privacy right and zero knowledge it is a great way to get some of that privacy back um so um another a lot of interesting ideas here um better public goods funding this is something that i think we've been talking about for the last two years right basically that like blockchain communities need ways to find public goods public goods are important for everyone but they're especially important in blockchain communities because blockchain communities are internet communities they depend heavily on open source software um public documentation that gets written on the internet people making translations uh just all kinds of work that's completely done in the open and it's extremely valuable but there is not a good way to charge for it right so better ways of like funding it and of like actually using um you know community pools of funds to support those things and even to support public goods that go beyond the blockchain space is something that i think is like really important to care about right now how can we do this i mean so quadratic funding is interesting so the bitcoin team has been doing these experiments for the last two years these uh quadratic funding rounds and at the beginning it was like this thing where you had like a 25 000 dollar matching pool and basically nobody cared about it but i think over time we've seen it like really grow in balloon and now it's this big i don't know five million dollar thing and you have just these really big matching pools that happen every year every couple of months which i think is amazing um but there is still like opportunities to improve quadratic funding and to try to make the mechanism better make it more um you know safe against um attacks make it more privacy preserving and all of these things so that this is one part of the public goods problem another way to look at the public goods problem is to look at it from the perspective of like credit assignment right so let's say that someone invents some amazing new zero-knowledge proof protocol and this new zero-knowledge proof protocol is like makes it let's say 10 times cheaper to scale ethereum roll-ups and improve privacy and it has some other magic amazing properties right now this is a public good it's something that once you do it it's in the open it gets published it benefits everyone it doesn't even just benefit the ethereum community it benefits you know every crypto community it goes like it could even benefit like lots of mainstream um you know industrial applications lots of government applications it can make a civil society more um applications more secure so it's a very public good um but one of the ways of like asking what the problem is is to look at it from the problem of like well who should get credit right and the answer almost never is one person right on the end because uh like it's easy to kind of tell who is like the last mile person who is responsible right like who is the guy who actually publishes the thing but the pers the person who publishes the thing like he did not invent or you know she did not invent the idea in a cave right like they read existing work uh synthesized existing work talks to people created one version of an idea found someone who broke that version of an idea fixed it created a better version of the idea there's always this collaborative process and each of the ideas that they built on are also ideas uh that um themselves um you know built on other on other ideas and like there is this big tree of uh like where the credit comes from uh so one thing to think about is like people i think have for a long time been thinking about like the kind of the providence problem right so this is like blockchain supply chain applications like people talked a lot about this in 2015 to 2017 um right like basically if you have um like if you get some product how do you tell like you know which country the different parts actually came from how do you tell like what's trustworthy can you like put cryptographic links at every step in the supply chain check them on uh check them on chain and all of that like we could do that for public goods as well right we could try to like take the concept of citations and formalize it make them cryptographic make them more incentive compatible have a kind of more this kind of richer information about them and just like have more information out there that could actually be used to properly compensate sort of everyone um all along the chain of like actually producing some public um nft is for public goods uh so like nfts have always been this sort of challenging topic for me because on the one hand like i think nfts could be like a really amazing fundraising tool and they could really help in like raising money for things that really need it and things that don't otherwise have business models right and they kind of already do there's like a lot of artists that are around the world and even people in places like you know southeast asia and africa and latin america that like really do get included and have finds a way of like making revenue through the nft ecosystem but on the other end like nfts can sometimes become this sort of ridiculous thing where people are trading three million dollar monkeys right so like to me like i guess my ideal world is like not uh like i don't want to hate nfts and i also don't want to uncritically like nfts but so like i want to build better nfts right and you know i want to it would be nice if we can like try to find a way to kind of get and make nfts benefit public goods more right so you know if you produce some like some uh public good um and then like find a way to kind of sell some nft for it and the public good like you know it could be some scientific result it could be a work of art um it could be a blog post it could be an idea uh basically find ways to kind of create an nft ecosystem that people wants to participate in but um and we are at the same time like you actually ensure that the people who get the funding aren't just kind of like very flashy and famous people at the end of the chain but try to actually make sure that sort of the entire um you know intellectual supply chain gets that compensated well so a lot of like i think interesting ideas to work on there um better dow governance uh so i think uh you know daos are great and lots of people are doing taos but at the same time like dao's have a lot of problems and governance like their governance is i in general i think it's like either centralized or attackable and like we see a lot of sometimes some pretty scary attacks right like last year i think very recently there was like a stable coin that got drained because someone bought up 51 percent of the supply of the tokens and made a governance operation to drain all the money and did that in like a flash alone in a single transaction um and the like these kinds of things like they happen because coin bait driven governance is like fundamentally broken right and i've written about this many times so this is like you know another post where i talk about this and there are ways that you can improve it on the margin but i think ultimately you need to have governance that is not coin driven um so this is also where things like sold bound tokens things like proof of humanity things like proof you know proof of community membership come in like we need to have governance that depends on things other than just um you know like token ownership and we need to like even get away from this idea that the purpose of a dow is like fulfilling the will of the token holders right there are other stakeholders that matter too uh so one of the directions to go is kind of non-coin-driven governance platforms and like i've talked about like ideas for how to do this in a couple of places but there's also the the problem of like actually building dow governance tools that use those ideas right like today everyone forks compound because there's just lots of really good tools that is that are like make dows easy to operate if you assume that your dow is a coin voting down and forks compound there aren't good tools if you want to build a dow some other way if you want to build it down some other way you have to do things yourself right and it's like you know in the last century you know we had like nobody gets fired for buying ibm or and here it's like nobody gets fired for uh forking compound right but i think more people should get fired for working compound and more people should get rewarded for like actually trying something different and so you know we have to actually build those tools and make it easier uh direction two is better communication platforms right like governance isn't just about voting voting is the last step in governance the steps that comes before is like how do you actually create ideas come to consensus on ideas even like improve ideas over time and like get feedback even before the final vote happens so that you know you actually can like better find an idea that makes say 90 of the community happy instead of just making 51 of the community happy so better communication platforms i mean there definitely are projects that are trying to kind of do this decentralized governance communication thing so i mean like radical exchange people they talk a lot about police right it's that's not a platform for kind of finding ideas that different uh self-communic different subcommunities can agree on and audrey tong from taiwan really likes it and it gets used a lot there so that's a one good example um but you can look at that and but i think there's also room for like a lot more experiments here but you know in general i think like dowsing better governance dollars need a better communication so lots of things to do here so those are just a few ideas i mean there's plenty more ideas that you can try but i think you know there's a lot of really interesting directions to work on there's a lot of very exciting uh potential in the space that exists now that did not exist two years ago but there's also still a lot of stuff that needs to be worked on and you know i hope that people here can be a part of the solution

  - Video: "Steps to the Digital State & Open Mic AMA - Vitalik Buterin"
    okay great so I'm apparently supposed to talk about digital States um so to start off um the way yeah that I tend to think about these things is that like new institutions are never going to be exact for like carbon copies of old ones right like they're never going to be exact like a better version of something that fits into the exact same box right so you know like when you have cars like cars don't perfectly replace horses there's things that horses can't do that cars don't do there's things that cars do that horses don't do you know there's a lot of differences between them um and when we talk about even like the internet replacing telephones or like the internet or the internet replacing like some aspects of in-person communication right like it's it's not about creating a new thing that is exact like that is to like the old thing except it's just better because like you know you you add this like piece of magic pixie dust and you know the like one particular aspect of it becomes 37 better for whatever reason like it often does end up changing like how we actually relate to like what fundamental problems that we're trying to solve right so when we talk about like the digital State like I even find it less interesting to ask the question of say yeah you know what can City governments do to become more digital or what can National governments do to become more digital or you know how can we coordinate um 10 000 people to go to the same location in the middle of a in the middle of a desert in Nevada and hopefully like actually create a new city with fancy blockchain quadratic stuff that actually works well um I like all of those questions are interesting um but prefer to kind of step back and just think about this from the point of view of like what are we trying to accomplish and you know why are we even having having this conversation and of what are the tools that we have and how do we kind of start to narrow the gap between the tools and the results right so I think the um most um fascinating thing about at least like this particular ethereum Community is that it just has this lovely combination of a whole bunch of like very positive cultures that I like right um so the first I read a very positive culture aspect that I like is just the fact that this Esa culture that is uh very interested in ideas like creating new institutions creating new ways for people to cooperate creating new governance structures um even creating new communication structures thinking about relationships between um communication and governance and like actually you know using things like blockchains and cryptography and incentives and tools and putting them together into these different like Arrangements where you know hopefully we'll build something that allows us to work allows us to work together on something better in some way um so that's the first thing that I like the second thing that I like is uh there is a uh I mean at least I think very Cooperative aspects to the community um like ever like everyone here is working together everyone here is kind of aligned on this uh set of several different many different Visions but still like fairly aligned Visions on just how to actually turn all of this into uh some kind of a better world um and I mean we even see like a lot of very positive interactions uh between the crypto community and institutions right like so the governor Jared Polis spoke here there's uh plenty of other people from um you know local government for many other kind many other institutions that are here what was that Wyoming wyomingdale yay Wyoming Wyoming is okay yeah I mean it was actually I was going to mention I mean I think the wyomingdale was like actually great and it's like one of the in like in my opinion the wyomingdale law actually is one of the best um examples so far of like governments doing something like something that like goes beyond like just um not like not breaking the industry that is actually like really helpful uh helpful to the the crypto spaces ability to thrive right because like what it basically is is I mean it's like government passes a law and it basically gives Dows this new superpower right like they can incorporate and they can and they can now legally own property and they can like actually legally do things and act as legal entities like that's probably one of the most powerful like kind of bridges between the crypto world and the ends of the traditional world that we have right and so because of that things like City Jail can exist because of that plenty of other projects can exist right so that's amazing um so I guess okay in Colorado and while filming there seems to be this little lovely Spirit of collaboration between the crypto community and um you know governments and many other kinds of Institutions so this is good right and the year so then the question is well okay so there's people in the the crypto community and there's people in existing institutions that are interested in these goals of using these new technologies to help people uh cooperate better um to you know create more open more free and more fair and more transparent forms of cooperation um and how do we actually take that energy and like what kinds of specific things can we work on in order to actually start to like you get closer to those kinds of outcomes now the reason why I kind of phrase things in this way is that it doesn't matter as much who does it right like so for example um you know if the state of Colorado like does something that enables some kind of some kind of crypto support across the stage it doesn't matter which then you know that's one way of doing it but what if instead the state of Colorado creates some kind of law that makes it easier for independent groups to spit out to whether it's Dallas whether it's local governments whether it's something else to the basic week work together themselves to achieve that same outcome and you end up having the same result right so sometimes I think like there is this solution of like taking existing um institutions and kind of pushing them in this direction and then there's sometimes there's this approach of this kind of more bottom-up approach right where you start with a small scale but something that's kind of purely crypto and purely digital and you do some experiments and some of those experiments fail some of those work and you scale it up from there and these New Paths are not opposing right like sometimes people think of these two paths or not as opposing I don't actually think that they are opposing um I actually think um that you know often they can complement each other um so often uh the you know as a wyomingdale law is um excellent example there right institutions can do something where once they do it from their institution the EGA institution doesn't need to do anything else and it actually creates space for it of the bottom-up community it's a and do all of this work and actually make all the all of the amazing progress happen right so I think that's like one um definitely great path to take um other paths to uh take would be obviously um you know starting from the ins from the institution and then kind of adding City coins can improve local governance by creating economic alignments within cities, but alternative techniques are needed to foster economic alignment without individual property ownership, and collaboration is required to develop frameworks for launching tokens and exploring blockchain-based DAO governance. pieces on top right so at the end of last year I wrote this article on City coins and you know City coins are this kind of concept that people have been starting to think about and like there's this idea of you know can we create coins that are attached to cities somehow and could potentially introducing City coins actually like fixed incentives and improve local governance and there are some interesting um things that you can do there right so like how can you create economic alignments between people in a city and the whole city like I think the traditional uh like way of doing this tends to be about encouraging like basically property ownership and land ownership and you know everyone must own a house and uh you know if you don't own a house and you and you love your avocado toast you're a bad person I know I love my avocado toasts um so but you know the reality is that like how is this or non-fungible um houses are you're either a renter and you're negatively exposed to your community or you're a buyer and you're just massively Overexposed to your community and the reality is that they're both irresponsible um how then you know houses are not they do not create economic alignment with the entire city they create economic alignments with a very small portion of a city and often um to the in in ways that create conflict with the rest of the city right so you know people often are like hey you know we want more development we want more great stuff but like not in my backyard right so the the idea of like can we create cities that have more economic alignment inside them and can we come up with techniques other than like individuals owning specific pieces of property I think it's a really good idea and it's an idea that like we don't know exactly the correct way to implement that idea um but you know there's a room for a lot of good experiments um and uh you know I guess this category of City coins would be one thing that we call those experiments so one right so City now City coins are just like one um example of like a thing that can be done but then there is the question of like who does it right and here again um this is uh like the there can actually be a lot of different answers right so like Miami coin for example is like this interesting project on one end of the spectrum where they basically say like okay this is basically just a community project um and it starts as a community project and it doesn't have any kind of direct connection to the city governments like you don't actually have like City defined legal rights as a result of it but you know it's gotten some support from the government um and you know maybe over time the coin's role might change who knows um so that's one way of doing it another way of doing it would be like for the city itself to actually create the coin so you know which of those approaches you take could you take some approach in between um you know it depends on the situation um but in in general General like if you are a city government and we want something like that to exist then like both of those routes do exist right like one of the things that you can do is you can do it yourself and one of the things that you can do is you can create the environment that makes it possible for other people in the community to basically do all the work for you right because there are lots of people in the community and there are lots of people that are very willing and very excited to do these kinds of interesting things and really Empower people but like in order for that to happen you know you actually do need to like somehow create some create a framework that is supportive of them there are Frameworks that are supportive of people there are Frameworks that are kind of like actively I guess anti-supportive of people right so you know legal Frameworks that for example make it easier to launch a token the the less your token promises people like in some ways that's actively antisupportive right and like coming up with uh you know structures that are better and coming up with like say ways to have for people to launch tokens where you actually have like that are more friendly to more friendly to the project the more aligned its incentives are this is like the sort of thing where you know we do need to kind of lots of people to work together to actually make it happen um and it is the sort of thing um that uh like it's great where it's great that we actually have lots of different kinds of people all in a room and where people have all of these different like interests and perspectives and can actually start working together um so that is and you know that is only one example right so you know there's plenty of other examples as well um so if we take like let's say yeah so the concept of uh you know this blockchain like Dao governance in general right and there there's this question of like how do we actually create like these Dao based structures that actually like do something in the main in in the mainstream somewhere right I think uh you know obviously a lot of people here Coin voting is not a good way to govern Dows, and improving blockchain scalability may require compromising decentralization, but data centers should only be allowed if they generate verifiable ZK Starks for blockchain voting, and a combination of cryptography, zero knowledge proofs, and encryption can potentially provide high bandwidth democracy with better security, privacy, and frequent participation. are working on Dallas and I feel like a lot of people here are working on doubt governance um there are plenty of ways of improving Dow governance so the way that many Dows are governed today coin voting I've written about this many times coin voting is just terrible um now okay wait wait I get collapsed we're just saying coin voting is terrible [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] um [Applause] uh coin voting is good okay good good this is uh see if okay maybe I should just like come up with a list of things and come up with a list of judgments and like randomly shuffle them and see what the response is um but okay if uh you know if let's see I should restart yeah so like I said you know so there's lots of things that we can that we can do to kind of bring you know improve uh blockchain so like for example if we want to like if we want to like really scale blockchains up I think you know sometimes we do have to make some compromises for decentralization and do some data center scaling collab for data center scaling you're not supposed to clap for data center scaling Okay so exactly decentralization no data centers unless Camilo okay if the data centers are generating zks and arcs and I can verify the ZK Stark on my phone then fine So speaking of UK's darks actually you know we talked about when we talked about this kind of concept of of like blockchain voting and this is one of those topics that I think is that like uh very interesting and I think it's actually it's like one of the natural kind of synergies between like cryptographic technology in general and a lot of the kind of governance Ambitions that people have but in some ways this is like one of the most challenging things to do well right and the basically the reason is that like on the one hand I think in general we do need to have like like there is a big opportunity I think to add much more of like what I would call kind of like good high bandwidth democracy um and today we have we have a lot of uh low bandwidth democracy right like you know you cast a ballot once every four years um so low bandwidth you know one bit of information every four years we have lots of high bandwidth things that are not democracy we have one lots of high bandwidth markets for example we also have lots of low security high bandwidth democracy voting on social media right you know someone makes a tweet it gets uh you know it gets 50 000 likes 50 000 retweets in two minutes well maybe it's actually one guy controlling all of them and it's a bot and you have no idea right so the challenge is that there's just like there are we like there clearly is this big need for kind of what a high bandwidth democracy in general um and there are already a lot of these applications that are providing high bandwidth democracy but they just tend to have very crappy security I mean and so the question is like can we have kind of like higher security high bandwidth democracy um and this is one of those things that I like I actually think potentially some kind of combination of cryptography and zero knowledge proofs and encryption action we can provide right like you do I think you do need all of the Technologies so like you need the encryption to make sure that nobody can see the votes they need zero knowledge proofs to make sure that the votes are being counted correctly um you need blockchains to make sure that whoever's counting the votes is not censoring anyone so we actually do need all of the pieces to come together right and you actually can create something with some pretty strong properties and there are even projects you know being kind of homegrown within the ethereum space that are trying to kind of make things like this possible but in order to um like in order for this to really work like it has to really be done well right you know it has to be efficient it has to actually be secure it has to actually be privacy preserving um and in terms of like where to actually accomplish this I think like like I actually feel like focusing on a kind of national level votes is almost like the like the wrong place to start it's like the last thing you should do instead of the first thing right like I think in general Crypt like adding kind of crypto features to existing governments can sometimes the best way that tend to make it work is not to actually like add in like crypto modifications to things that already exist it's to build completely new things that have better properties that people we're going to appreciate because they make it possible to do things that are not possible today okay yeah um so you know what this is what this is a big part of why like for example I'm a big fan of quadratic funding right and I think quadratic funding is that even something that could easily be applied at the government level right like you know or at the you know state level at the city level at many kinds of political levels there are many kinds of local public goods and it might you know people do have like all sorts of kind of this widely distributed information about like what kinds of these public goods they actually find valuable I mean and so if we want to actually kind of gather together this kind of information then you know we do want something that's high bandwidth we do want something where um if people actually where people can participate at actual at a reasonable frequency and dude we also do want something that's secure right so you know if we come up with some kind like some fully decent like decentralized a blockchain based quadratic funding platform that provides all of the security and the pro and the Privacy guarantee is that a governance system needs to have to be resistance to things like say bribery attacks this could actually be something really valuable right and if something like this gets built then you know potentially you could just get adopted so now this in some ways like it doesn't like a lot of this stuff doesn't even need to kind of wait for um you know big for big institutions right in some ways like one of the way or the the watch it's based all by itself is powerful right and the watch it's based all by itself you know it can build things and the blockchain space by itself can do demonstrations and you know even git coin grants by itself I think has been just an amazing demonstration you know I have like 12 rounds of quadratic funding supporting importance public goods in the ethereum ecosystem we've had a lot of chances to see like what it looks like you know tens of thousands of participants what kinds of things it's great at what kind what kinds of things it's me it's um it misses and it's actually in my opinion become like a a pretty significance and importance to all behind and how the ethereum ecosystem funds things that people in the ecosystem consider important um so that like um don't you know the more experiments and the more demonstrate like the the demonstrations like this that you can do like theoretically you know we could just like go and say we are just going to have a a gig when grants uh round for like say businesses in Boulder for example right like that is something that you know the community in Boulder can do um and I think it's interesting like this kind of um like actually like trying to like start materializing kind of like the online um the benefits of you know the online community and the offline world I think it's something that we actually can start doing more of it is something that the crypto space has kind of tried doing repeatedly on a number of occasions right so like for example back in 2013 I mean when we had Bitcoin and when you know we had Bitcoin payments and back when cryptocurrency transaction fees were still so low that being cheaper than with then PayPal was part of the sales pitch it will be again Ethereum is progressing with low fees, Roll-Ups, and sharding, while also focusing on wider adoption through initiatives like convincing stores to accept ETH and implementing Ethereum-based identity for decentralized usernames and service sign-ins. um no but you know Let's uh oh no I should have like come up with some uh some phrase by some famous military leader that had to retreat from a country and promise to return but you know ethereum with five cent transaction fees we will be back and uh Roll-Ups are already making a huge amount of progress you know sharding is already making a huge amount of progress so you know it's not just words you know the uh the the soldiers are already under development um so but anyway like so back in those days when we did the uh when what people would actually try to like or figure out specific cities and convince like or specific districts and convince people in this like very large districts to just accept cryptocurrency or or I guess in that case except Bitcoin right because back then you know realistically Bitcoin maximalism kind of was correct and that every cryptocurrency except for Bitcoin wasn't that interesting back in 2013 but you know anyway it it actually in my opinion it was interesting you know it's something that can create local community um so now that scaling technology is actually are on the horizon it might actually make sense to kind of go back and start doing some more of this more of that sort of stuff right but when we do like that doesn't have to kind of limit itself to just things like convincing stores to accept eth for payments right like that could actually mean things like actually you know if doing quadratic funding rounds like basically saying you know hey you know we we as a community are going to organize like say a two million dollar matching pool and um you know people can go and actually like vote and kind of participate in the in the in the quadratic matching and we can actually see how that goes that's an experiments right like you can actually like start doing these things and if these things are successful then I think that you know they're going to be picked up on right so quadratic funding is like in my opinion one of those kind of like examples of what I would call high bandwidth democracy that has actually been I mean it like it definitely not perfect for everything but it but it has been good at kind of capturing some important niches that existing forms of funding are missing and so the other question is like where do you go beyond where do you go from there right you know there's all there's lots of ideas kind of different pieces of infrastructure that need to happen like there is payments there is this kind of concept of identity and reputation and the concept of identity and reputation already has been making a lot of progress right like I think people think about if you're like identity like ethereum identity in the wrong way or people think about kind of blockchain ID in the wrong way right and what I mean by this is like I believe in blockchain idea but I do not believe in blockchain ID platforms um so what I mean by this is like I think the version of ethereum based identity that's going to succeed is the version that is being implemented as we speak that has been happening over the last few years without anyone actually calling it that and the people that are trying to like do they do an entire stack themselves they're basically just creating kind of silos isolated from the ecosystem that are going to fail so what do I mean by like ethereum identity that we already have so we have ens right ethereum the ethereum name system so if you have an ethereum address then you know you can register an ens name and you already have something that people can use like kind of you basically have a decentralized username for the ethereum world um if then we have signed in with ethereum so you can use your ethereum your ethereum account whether or not you have an ens name to sign into services including centralized web services um so in these two composed with each other so for example if you go to chat.blockscan.com so etherscan made this a lovely chat application that actually like accept sign in with ethereum and you know if you have if you have an ethereum address you can sign in but everyone's going to see your name as like 0x blah blah blah for these quickly characters now if instead you have an ens name then people connect are going to actually see your account as being like your like your ens name as your username right so we already see synergies between those two things already then we have attestation so there's proof of humanity attestations there's just like whether or not your account sent a transaction it's like the simplest form of like blockchain based anti-spam you can possibly have there is um you know potentially like in the future whether or not you're running a validator there is whether or not you have a pope there's like what kind of Pope do you have so you know there is The speaker emphasizes the importance of building an open and interconnected digital government infrastructure in the Ethereum community, collaborating to solve challenges, and considering the switch to proof of stake for scalability and environmental concerns. this growing ecosystem of like attestations about accounts that are happening right and like this is sort of the ethereum identity layer that already exists that's already growing and that like it's open and and it's this kind of growing kind of ecosystem that ever anyone can take advantage of and anyone can piggyback on so going back to kind of like building the digital State then you know one of the questions to ask would be like well no don't really think about it in terms of kind of the state creating you know its own kind of closed Silo system like actually think about the question of like well can we design like this more digital government infrastructure in a way that it's actually more open and that it actually does kind of talk to or at least it's able to talk to some of these things that the ethereum community is building right so I guess and of conclusions from from all of this are right like one is I think this kind of really um important idea of like don't think about it in terms of like what can this specific institution do think about it in terms of like what problem is being solved um and who like what are the different groups of people that can work together to actually do it right and often like you are going to need like different groups of people from different from like from different parts of the room to actually work together this is a actually one of the most beautiful things that I know that I've seen about crypto we just have huge amounts of cross-institutional collaboration that just nobody even recognizes so like for example zero knowledge proof protocols zero knowledge proof protocols they get frequently designed in by and kind of collaborated in you know things like telegram chats and like all sorts of other informal media that like contains some combination of you know you have like if University scientific researchers if you're in Foundation researchers Aztec people Z cash people and it's just kind of this assorted mythbrush of people and if something needs to be done they just come together and they do it right so we have that for technology you know we've had that for many zero knowledge proof algorithms we have that more and more for all kinds of things in the ethereum ecosystem like erc4337 account abstraction you know started with a telegram chat and there's like people from at least like four different different in some organizations that are just coming in and working together and just working on making it happen right so like that kind of approach and like basically seeing like what is the function that you're trying to accomplish and like you know who are the people that needs to do to actually work together and make it happen and like can we actually make that happen like can we actually get people to uh work to get work together and make it happen um there's uh a lot of things that I think you know we can really innovate in um so I think you know in some ways decentralized governance is a kind of one of the big challenges of the 21st century and I think it's a big or it's an important challenge even going kind of far outside of the crypto Space by itself right I think it's uh like coming up with forms of governance or even just the kind of large-scale social systems in general that satisfy kind of a lot of the properties including many of the properties that the crypto Space is really going after like it is something that's really important for many kinds of people right um so how can we actually make that happen like so you know how like what kinds of people needs to come together to make this happen um what kind like how do we actually make that collaboration um that collaboration happen like what is one particular instance of the problem that we actually can start to get solved like is it you know do actual like get really trying hard to kind of push quadratic funding and getting quadratic funding out there as something that you know just more and more people in all kinds of ecosystems do that could be an answer um you know is could there be other kinds of local governance applications like could there be like some kind of micro voting um you know happening on like Street by Street zoning or whatever I don't know I mean like the like potentially what if we if you want something that the community can do by itself like you could even like we don't even have to do to do binding votes right like you can start with signaling votes like I think the ethereum ecosystem actually way back then way back in the good old days way back when we had more kind of deeply controversial yetps than we did today there was this interesting kind of custom where people would do these kind of community and non-binding signaling votes on them sometimes it would be coin votes sometimes there would be like votes without votes and down votes on GitHub sometimes there would be votes by from known community members and people just make these votes and like there was also be non-binding but they would be internal signals that people could still listen to and determine like whether or not some particular thing that they want to do actually would have consensus right so can we do like signaling votes might be another sort of application that like the community here could start doing um and then over time it could kind of end up growing and like something that is started as a purely kind of advisory and signaling thing could potentially get kind of taken up by existing institutions that if it works well then it could just kind of naturally start getting assigned more and more importance right so kind of can you build something that does something now but it does something enough useful now that once if it succeeds well enough then it is in a good position that existing institutions could just decide to kind of assign more and more power and more and more importance to it and then it starts scaling up as a new institution from there right I mean think like like Glenn Weil like it talks a lot about kind of what he calls fork and merge governance and in some ways this is kind of this is like a similar idea right it's like can you create a kind of these institutions that start off being completely independent and you know if they succeed kind of the goal is basically is that they just start becoming more and more important and like they're you can't say they replace existing things because I don't think the goal is like replace the existing things so much as it is creating entirely new things and maybe the results of creating entirely new things is that existing things stop being important um but that's um yeah mm-hmm yeah so you know maybe start by creating these entirely new things and then like let's uh you know see what happens right so that's some another thing and then third piece is like the the technology right so like we do have to think about like what is the technology that needs today builds to kind of make all of these different things possible I think uh you know scalability is number one because scalability is always well is is always number one aside from of course the switch to proof of stake the switch to proof stake is important um and you know there are I think like a lot of people that do have uh like these deep concerns about the environmental issues of cryptocurrency as today and I do think um you know like those concerns are fair um and you know I think our risk like our response to these concerns never has been that those concerns are fake news I think our response has always been that you know hey you know this is why proof of snake has been part of our Theory ethereum's roadmap almost since the beginning and this is why finally after like seven years of research and development proof of stake is you know finally like literally running on working test Nets and and it's looking like a month away from a final launch um yeah so actually on that topic I mean I I have an interesting um suggestion if you like if you're listening to this and you're from an institution and your job like and you're really interested in doing something with um ethereum but you know that you're you know you're going to get criticism because people are concerned about environmental issues then here's what you could do you could announce that you're interested in watching this some this crypto integration or this ethereum integration but you are going to do it the week after ethereum does the merge if the ethereum merge gets delayed until 2025 you're not going to do it until 2025. if it happens in June you're gonna do it in June right like just announce that and so you know you're lucky like it's you're not contributing to the environmental challenge in fact you're actually you're contributing to the motivation for this community to kind of keep to keep up the good work and finally get the thing over the finish line so I'm gonna and this is uh yeah I don't know so you know the so technology scalability is important to Privacy is essential for effective institutions, including democracy, as it prevents coercion and manipulation of votes, and can be implemented in a platform where users remain anonymous but prove their uniqueness for authenticity, while collaboration between different groups is crucial for making a large-scale impact. the proof of stake is importance and also privacy um I think uh you know we don't talk some like I I feel like I try to talk a lot about blockchain privacy but watching privacy actually is really important and blockchain so blockchain privacy is important in actually with just like so many different ways I would probably say one of the biggest misconceptions that people have about privacy in general is that privacy is like either entirely or even a primarily a tool for um for resisting bad institutions now to be clear I think resisting bad Institute um resisting bad institutions is important you know there's plenty of not just governments but also corporations but also even just um you know public mobs just like all kinds of actors that you know do do like do things that they really should not be doing um and people being able to do things privately without kind of broadcasting to the world or broadcasting so the powers that be everything that they're doing as part of their lives is a really important check and balance against that sort of thing um but I think that's not the only function of privacy the other function of privacy is actually that privacy is often a very necessary part of making this of making institutions that work um probably the biggest example of this is uh the the secret ballot right so everyone's familiar with the secret ballot right like when you vote um like with a paper ballot the Voting is done in such a way that no one can tell where you're like no one can like no one can tell who you voted for and you can't prove how you voted even if you wanted to prove how you voted although but so there is a guarantee like the system does try very hard to make it easy to show that that the votes are counted correctly but at the same time it preserves this privacy um and like it preserves this kind of inability to prove how you participated and this is really powerful right it's really powerful because you can't coerce people to vote in a particular way you can't coerce people not to vote um you can't uh buy people's votes you can't sell your vote and this is all real a really important part in preventing the entire system from basically being captured by concentrated interests that are willing to put to throw huge amounts of money into buying up everyone's votes now you know you might be cynical and you might think that like oh but they do this anyway it's called lobbying but like no no no no you know like if you Lobby like okay fine you know you can like pay people to like go to go to like blab to politicians if you haven't answered give them nice dinners and like fine you know but that's still there's still this like this much bigger filter like there's a very huge difference between that and like literally actually not even having to come up with arguments that convince people because your argument is like hey if you vote for me able to give you 15 bucks like by the way like um okay like can I just like do a quick poll um everyone close your eyes um secret ballad um who here would um would vote for who some stranger on the street tells them to vote if they gave him 15 bucks okay see it's uh surprise so surprisingly virtue was crowd here um 150 bucks hmm getting up president peep yeah okay so 100 see him so I think but you know once those numbers start going up okay so this is actually a good point right so I think if you make secret battle let's go like as like if you try to make bribes kind of like as blatant as they as like hey if you vote for this guy I'm gonna give you 50 bucks then like often you're gonna get lots of people who do resist but here's what you could have right like especially any blockchain contacts especially in this kind of digital context where you know information travels much more freely and much more loose way then what is going to like what you can obfuscate your Vibes so I'm not by see I'm not buying your vote I'm being a delegate and as a delegate I'm offering rewards as a delegate I am sharing some of the public goods Revenue that I get back to you the people who support me see doesn't that sound like something you want to contribute to but you know in reality it's economically equivalent to bribing right so you know this is like stuff that's already happened in lots of blockchains um so this is a sort of a secret ballots sorry basically privacy in general it's like a really powerful tool and just like limiting the damage that these kinds of things can do right and privacy in general is a just a really powerful and really important look just ingredients in making effective in making effective institutions for that reason like I think it's a a really powerful ingredient for democracy it's even a really powerful ingredient for systems of communication right like I think one of the things that somebody should build um is a platform where people can say things anonymously and they can upvote and downvote things anonymously but in order to get an account you have the zero knowledge prove that you're a unique human so like you have the zero knowledge proof that you have that you have a particular proof of humidity profile and only then can you participate and only then do you get one vote right so we get the Privacy benefits of anonymity but you know that if something has 300 of votes it was supported by 300 unique people and not you know some some bot that just can that that just created 300 fake accounts so you know this is one of the nice things that we can do with this technology it's powerful these are powerful tools right like we could get very strong privacy and very strong safety and authenticity gains at the same time and you know lots of people here in the room are I think a big part of like like making this kind of Technology possible so technology technology can make a big difference existing institutions I think existing institutions things like the Wyoming Wyoming Bell and you know things like some of the kind of support to projects like City coins that they've given I think can be very helpful and very important and yay um okay by the way is there anyone here from us somewhere other than Colorado or Wyoming [Music] okay cool yeah so is that is anyone here part of a doubt of any of those regions okay cool yeah see so we need Texas Dallas right so this is yay Texas now um see this is good right like you know it gets uh like you see the question isn't like how do like maybe the answer to how do we cryptoify it like say Texas isn't how do we like convince the Texas state governments to add more things one by one maybe the solution is like let's do Texas now and then Texas now starts off being this kind of thing that's just a bunch of volunteers um and they just wants to want to do local community projects and then more and more people join and then it just becomes more and more powerful organically on its own maybe that is the solution right so like both of those Solutions exist like you can basically convince the big thing to improve incrementally or you can go incrementally by making a very pure small thing and having it grow over time and both of those paths are good and sometimes those paths even need to work together um so basically you know that those are kind of the takeaways like try and think through like what actually is the path toward making something with a large-scale impact don't just think about like what specific like how to reform one specific institution think about like maybe the solution does actually involve like people from three different groups coming together maybe the solution involves uh people from like 20 different uh different groups coming together and I think like that kind of work is actually how we're going to kind of get uh somewhere close uh to this kind of like you know um I guess you know Dao based solar Punk world where you know everything is happy and the yeah um and and the buffer buff Accords can dance and the above and the buffer chords can accept cardano so okay yay questions yeah if you have a question you can come down and get in line and we'll take them just for about about seven minutes maybe 10 minutes 10 minutes please hold on okay hold on here you go [Music] sleeping right there right here okay wow you guys all right all right okay that's good now hey how you doing good how about the pants by the way aren't those pens hot right let's get around Applause don't don't yeah my name is Tony I'm I'm from North Carolina I got a question I think a lot of people want to ask how do you feel about Solana I don't know what's the line of school it seems sunny [Laughter] hey vitalik my name is Brecken Hager I actually started Texas Dow with a few lawyers here it'll be legally recognized as the second Dao in America next week my first question is do you believe in The speaker emphasizes the importance of preventing centralization in Ethereum and maintaining diversity within the community to prevent misuse, while also highlighting the hindrance of forcing KYC and AML regulations in all layers of the ecosystem and the influence of culture on technology development. God what is God it depends depends okay and then the second question is with throughout history and with decentralization especially Mass decentralization one great centralization is inevitable how can ethereum and how can you make sure that this doesn't become a one-world you know in government so I guess like how to make sure that ethereum doesn't like itself turn into some kind of like centralized pull that like actually like controls things and yeah I mean I think it's definitely an important question um I think the biggest defense that we have if it gets to that isn't even a technical defense the biggest defense is like what kind of community that we have and I think uh the biggest uh the biggest virtue that I think the community has that I want to seek cultivated even more like basically is the like the diversity that it has and like I mean the and like I mean the diversity in like a very broad sense right like you know we have people interested in like focused on technology we have people in institutions um do we have people in uh Texas you know we have people in kind of Far Corners of the of the world that are that are very outside of the us we have people that are like interested in ethereum in order to accomplish different things um and so the My Hope Is that as long as the community kind of keeps this the pluralist spirit that it currently has um and the like that that by itself can be a defense against like either you know the ethereum blockchain or kind of things that are close that are closely attached to it from kind of turning into tools that get that kind of get used to control people and and impose bad outcomes I mean specifically speaking my biggest concern with I've been when I read the ethereum white paper in ninth grade it changed my life but now with data partitioning around the corner oh sorry forgive me don't that operation are religious freedom that's all I ask thanks no I support short and sweet so um many members of the community are advocating right now for going full kyc and AML for um promoting the adoption of uh of the masses and the institutions what would your message to the sector of the community be um I mean I think by the the message is that like one is just like privacy is important um and in other is that inquiry like inclusion is important um and I think the biggest kind of like inclusion that things like like forcing kyc and AML into like all into more lawyers of the ecosystem prevent actually is uh like it basically forces the system to to discriminate much more by nationality um right because it basically creates a students where you know if you're in the US and you have all of your U.S infrastructure and you can participate easily but then if you are in some other country then potentially you know your entire country might get labeled a money laundering risk and then suddenly like you basically just because of where you were born like you have a heart you have a much harder time participating and like that sort of stuff really you know goes against what I think are a lot of the kind of core benefits that that the blockchain space is trying to accomplish um so I would say that um you know Kayla kyc and AML uh like like at the level of exchanges and at the level of like like centralizing like these infrastructure providers that are kind of like serving as you know Bridges from crypto to the rest of the space like that's fine and that's legally um unavoidable in any case but I think uh you know the it is really important especially for things really close to the core of the space um to like still have that kind of like this kind of full um level of like both open like openness compatibility with people's ability to preserve privacy and all these values because like if the base player doesn't have those things then nothing built on top of it possibly can huh yeah [Applause] um maybe it's Alec My Name is Oliver uh there's a quote I think about a lot and I can't tell if it's true uh it says that Society is Downstream of technology and I think you're uniquely qualified to give an opinion on this do you see society as more shaped by technology as a force that inevitably moves forward or do you think we can pick our areas to innovate in places that are more likely to shape Society in the way I think Society can be shaped by technology but a thick technology can also be shaped by culture um I can I could even give like very specific like very specific examples of this um so like one very subtle one is like let's take let's say psihub for example right like so Sai Hub you know this like online website where anyone can go and download scientific like scientific papers and like the whole thing is totally copyright infringing right and like in in many cases um and like it lets people get this stuff for free um despite the fact that the paperback you know there's this University publisher kind of like infrastructure that and copyrighted all this that really doesn't want you to so this exists for um for science favors but and it's very easy to use for science papers but it exists less effectively for same music for example right and one of the reasons why I think it exists um like less like the tools for doing this for scientific papers are so much stronger than this was for doing this for music is because there is a much like an even stronger social consensus that like like scientific papers really should all be open access and free and in reality you know there is a like like there isn't a like any like a good argument that like oh this should be restricted because like because the scientist needs to be paid because like well realistically like we know that there is plenty of like there are plenty of ways of paying them and like often the the revenue collected by this kind of University system doesn't end up actually all like going to support research that much right and like you know people can make those Arguments for like say music as well and you know people like the pirate parties have but like it is I think in general people believe that like the case is significantly stronger in four scientific papers and so as a result of like these moral views that people have like the technology for the tools for making scientific papers Open Access like basically by force like it is just like much easier and and much more developed right so like that's one tiny example of how like even just moral views that people have end up influencing like what specific kinds of in this case like basically copy protection evasion in technology but it could could also be censorship resistance technology it could also be technology in general let people spend their time working on um and I think that's true in a like ends up being true much more broadly um so you know the more people value The speaker discusses the importance of privacy in technology development, emphasizing the potential of blockchains and zero knowledge proofs, and suggests Ethereum should have a test net with economic incentives; they also discuss improving airdrops through proof of participation and address the issue of increasing female participation in the Ethereum space. privacy the more there are going to be smart people working on making zero knowledge proofs and like an encryption work much better and much easier to use the more people value um say the like the the doing the more people value doing things like um having a better life in the um on the internet the more there will be you know software develops to try to you know make better forms of virtual reality better ways for us to interact online meanwhile the more people value um interact with improving the physical world the more we're gonna see like you know all sorts of like new kinds of advanced like uh forms of transportation the more we're going to see supersonic Jets the more we're going to see it like better ways of building buildings and and all of this stuff right and like the rate at which those different trajectories can progress so I could think it does depend on the kinds of values that people have um so I do think that you know technology influence definitely has big influences on society technology has big influences enormous but I think that like culture has big INF influences on the technology that gets built as well and like I do think that like eventually everything is going to get invented by I think the order in which things get invented does matter right like and especially if it's technologies that have to do with you know things like privacy where we're basically talking about like giving the little guy the ability to kind of like resist the bit like or like basically some kind of like defense against the big the big guy trying to trying to Snoop on everyone and see what everyone is doing right like in that case it's not even a matter of like how fast everything gets developed it is a matter of like well is this side of the technology being developed faster or is this out of the technology being developed faster and I think you know if we have a culture that values privacy then like the technology that um creates more privacy will actually develop faster than the technology that breaks privacy and like in my own opinion that it's a good thing so you know answer yes culture matters thank you hi vitamic uh I had one question um what is one use case of blockchains that you think is over hyped right now and what is one use case that you think is uh neglected and we should focus more on um I mean neglected and we should focus more on like I think is the intersection of blockchains and zero knowledge proofs um like people focus on it a lot but I still think that people don't focus on it enough um in terms of uh something that is over hyped um I mean I'll give the boring answer which is governance tokens I think you know people still do governance tokens too much I think people should do more of like governance using any way that's not a token just so we can experiment with new models and see what happens perfect thank you and where'd you get those trousers from A friend bought them for me as a gift so yeah hey Dalek my name is Brian um thanks for existing by the way um earlier today on this stage a lady from the polkadot ecosystem has asked the interesting question of what is something that ethereans can learn from polka dot her answer was look at what they're doing with kusama instead of having a bunch of test Nets have like a live in production with real value move fast break things and kandering the Coleman is is that a bad idea um I would definitely support that I mean I've definitely like I definitely think that we sh having something that's kind of like between a tested and a main nut that has like some economic incentives it definitely could be valuable I mean I think in general we actually need to be bolder with our test stats like you know where is the ethereum proof of stake test net that has a one second slot time um you know where is the uh ethereum test that that has a young 140 million gaffle images so we can see what happens I think uh you know we do like having more and different kinds of tested Nets and including test debts that have more of like that that have kind of enough realness to test like economic um uh properties and not just technical ones definitely something that I really support thank you uh thank you very much Metallica we're out of time dude okay I mean you can stick around and do q a all night if you want I mean I'll answer one last one all right it's up to him all right um I like the walkabee Hat by the way it's one thing I just want to say before we answer the final question because it's gonna get scattered we have the fire marshall here who's concerned about our Exodus so please do so calmly we have the door through the other stage here the infinity stage that's actually open to the garage so there's actually two equal exits so thank you for coming vitalik go ahead thank you sir so I'm very interested in what is said about at the stations other than proof of humanity what do you think are the main building blocks still missing in that space and how is that space going to evolve okay um the one of the things that I'm excited about is like this concept of like either like proof of participation or even like proof of learning proof of like uh proof of having particular skills um so one of the voices of the that where this can be important is airdrops right like I feel like ear drops are the sort of thing where like initially everyone really loved them right like because you know the restrictive swap airdrop which you know in the middle of the darkest days of the coronavirus just kind of like stood up and said hey guys everyone whoever use uniswab got this lovely 1400 stimulus check and you know I think that was amazing um but obviously since then people have started gaming their job people started like farming addresses and there's professional VC Farms that Farm address and all this stuff so if you want to improve your job so from that perspective then we make them proof of humanity gated right like you need to have an account that actually has it for a community profile by the way ideally whenever I talk about this stuff I assume that like this stuff should have like some zero knowledge while you're in between to protect privacy it always should um so but that only solves part of the problem right the other part of the problem with airdrops is that I think project teams themselves are increasingly unhappy with them and the reason why they're unhappy with them is that you're basically you know spewing out large numbers of tokens to to an undifferentiated massive people without much regard for how much each of those people actually cares about your project what you want to do is you want to distribute tokens to people who care um so this is where I think like the what what would be ideal is you know if you learn something about a project you get some number like you get some number of tokens if you perform some unit of work for a project you get some number of tokens if you like help a project translate a page you get some number of tokens and ideally this would be done to like one kind of like like basically give people a kind of like an on-ramp where people while they are earning tokens they would also actually be kind of like becoming more like helping to understand the ecosystem the the project that they're participating in and even being on ramp too like eventually like having enough skills to be full-time contributors right so like you're you're satisfying the function of like being an airdropper and while we're Distributing the tokens and so you know it's okay if you're paying people 45 bucks to do something that like if you really wanted to you could do much more cheaply because like the goal is you're paying 45 bucks for people to like potentially become you know become a new user of this project and like become much more much more useful like way down the line right so if we want things like that to happen then like some version of Pope that like proves that you look did some particular thing um it like proves that you like say yeah you know what passed through some exercise that involves the learning about how a project works that proves that you like just performed some kind of tasks inside of a project like that sort of stuff the more infrastructure like that we have then you know one of the nice things that we can get as a result is we can have better airdrops and I mean people have started doing this before right like there's like the coin there's coinbase earners rabbit hole.gg and there's this kind of like growing list of projects but like I do feel like we need especially for projects that are launching new tokens like you'll be it will be amazing if you could seem even more of that stuff hmm yeah okay okay yay okay what up what oh um can you turn can you turn there we go here we go all right sorry we we here we need one uh one woman to come up here so she had something really important to say so one more question please vitalik okay hi my name is Irina and I see very few women here and a lot of men question to you is how do we get more women involved and maybe in which sectors would you want to see or would you like to see them where what areas um I mean the answer for where we would want to see women is I think like anywhere where like like anywhere where they will like where women wants to be I think right right like that's uh but in terms of like how to make that happen I mean I I even feel like I'm not the right person to answer that stuff like I feel like that like if you like you know like women who have who are part of the the ethereum space and like especially who who feel like they are part of the space who join the space later than the um and then they could have like what is your answer I mean like I think like actually like I I even kind of like wants to um wants to ask their ask for the crowd this more than myself um so oh no no okay make a dowel yep no oh yeah

  - Video: "The Future of Ethereum 2022 - Vitalik Buterin"
    okay great so today okay so today what i wanted to talk about is uh some of the stuff that's going to happen in ethereum over the next couple of years but also talk about it from the point of view not just of like what what's going to happen with the technology but also from the point of view of like what does this actually mean for the people who and who are building things on ethereum uh so what probably the biggest use this year right is uh the merge is coming uh so the merge is uh so ethereum switched to proof of stake this effort that we have been working on for basically the last um eight years right so the first uh on a blog post that we wrote about proof of stake was uh in back in january 2014 and in the years since then a lot of research has happened in uh 2017-2018 we converged on what we call the beacon chain today the version of group of steaks that we ended up actually implementing um one and a half years ago the beacon chain was actually launched and so pretty soon what's going to happen is um this complete switch where ethereum finally switches over to being a pure proof of stake system and basically what happens there is um the ethereum's um application layer so the applications the smart contracts balances everything that happens happening inside of ethereum is going to be automatically moved off of the proof of work chain which will basically just like stop being uh functional at that point and move over to the river state chain right so after the merge ethereum will finally become a proof stake system yay so now the merge is um only the first step in this fairly long and complicated roadmap that we have right so after the merge uh there's a bunch of other things that we have plan on focusing on but probably the biggest focus immediately after the merge is going to come on scalability right so scalability is also a problem that we've been talking about we've been complaining about we've been thinking about how to fix pretty much since the beginning of the ethereum project and even before the chain launched them all those years ago and and it's uh something where we've been actively thinking about it there have been a lot of groups that have been actively developing solutions and there's a lot that has happened over the last couple of years in the layer 2 space in particular right so some of the roll-up projects so projects like optimism arbitrage you know zk sync lubering scroll start that time you know this big long list of things is exists now um and that's uh that's something that did not exist at all um you know it's three years ago and it's just made a huge amount of progress over even the last year right but there's even more work on scalability left to go so people who have been following the ethereum core development process might have heard of prototank charting um so this is this one of the next big eips that is in the process of development and is coming to ethereum after the merge so basically the goal of prototake charting is to create what we call these data transactions that have these data blocks and the point of this is to just increase the capacity of the ethereum chain to hold a much larger amount of data right and there's this very nice synergy between these data blobs and the layer 2 roll-up projects because roll-ups can are very good at scaling transactions but they need some space to put their data and expanding the blockchain's ability to hold more data that these layer two roll-up projects can use is exactly um what a prototank charting is about right now prototank charting as you can tell from the name it's only the first step right so after prototake charting there's going to be a second step which is just called game sharding and dink charting will massively increase the number of these data blocks that the chain can hold but so that's the long-term roadmap right the long-term roadmap is to basically increase the amount of data that the ethereum chain can hold up to somewhere around 16 megabytes every swat right and today the average block is only about 80 kilobytes so like massively increasing the amount of data that that ethereum chain can hold um and it's done over the next a couple of stages prototank charting is the first stage and even prototake charting by itself is going to be a big improvement over how much data the ethereum chain can hold today now at the same time as improving how much data the ethereum chain can hold there's also another effort that's happening at the same time which is improving how much data roll-ups use right so this is uh so data compression in roll-ups this is uh something that i've talked for a long time about as something that really needs to happen uh basically trying to pack a much larger number of transactions into a much smaller amount of space so that like we just get you know a big scalability game for free right we can pack more transactions without really having to spend more resources at all so this is just a that's a chart that i published about a week ago that kind of shows the different stages and like how much you could do right so a transaction by itself and this is an erc20 token transfer uh takes about 188 bytes and if you add like different forms of compression so taking out zero bytes gets you down to 154 bytes i'm doing some signature aggregation takes it down to 128 making a stateless compression even better 75 and then even more advanced compression that kind of where the decompression algorithm can look into the chain and look into the history you can go all the way down to 23 right so there's like a lot of this some work is work that's actually started to happen so a couple of months ago um optimism actually implemented a zero byte compression um and erc 4337 is also an effort that's been really picking up ski more than over the last couple of months right so a lot of effort to help the ethereum chain uh hold a lot more data and a lot of effort to help every individual transaction in a roll-up use less data so we're talking about ethereum over the next couple of years being able to process a much larger amount of transactions than it has been able to before right so what do these two things mean for ethereum right so these are not the only two technical upgrades that are happening to ethereum but there's probably the two most important ones right but you know what what does this actually mean for ethereum from the point of view of someone using it or someone building on it uh so starting off with the merge right so the merge is going to happen first so ethereum's energy consumption will be reduced by more than 99.9 percent yeah so yeah so um it's a big improvement obviously um to this there's um a bunch of ways in which brew of steak improvement improves security um and also the merge opens the door to more upgrades right so at the same time as being a switch from proof of work to breast take it's also an opportunity to kind of take some of the ideas that we've learned over the last like eight years and use that to really redesign um what the different parts of the ethereum chain so like for example um the words will also make ethereum much more friendly to white clients right so today if you want to access the ethereum chain like a lot of most people generally use like some wallet like metamask and the way those wallets work is they talk to a server and they basically trust whatever answers the server gives them uh so with uh live clients after the merge like once that tech is developed you will be able to like basically have a client that actually verifies the data that it gets back so basically the merge isn't just about the merge the merge is also about other things down the line that the merge is going to enable so that's the merge uh prototank charting so opens up more data space transactions will become cheaper and compression means the transactions get even cheaper again right cheap cheap cheap yay so yeah i don't know [Applause] yeah i know i mean i know there's uh you know inflation and like eight and a half percent and like gas prices are going up but like here gas prices are going down [Applause] so what can we do with a safer blockchain and cheaper transactions right i think this is uh probably the big question um so probably one of the big and really important things is just lower transaction fees are the thing and the only thing that can make blockchains affordable for anyone right so um immediate income per day in canada at least according to the data at this link here is about 113 dollars so this is all in us dollars just to kind of put whatever put all the different countries in the same unit um in poland a median income per day is uh 42 um in mongolia goes down to 16 and in zambia goes down to four dollars right so very big differences um and we can compare against these numbers average transaction fees on ethereum for the last couple of years now obviously they've gone up and down a lot but generally they've it's been somewhere in between one and twenty dollars right now today if your transaction fees are fortunately a bit lower but um you know that's because we're in a bit of a bear market at least relative to you know 2021 so that's obviously not something that we can count on right like it's uh like basically if um you know if we see one of these uh both cycles uh pop up again anytime soon then like you know even the cheap transaction fees that we see today you know it's not going to happen or no fees are going to go crazy again right uh so that's on the ethereum base winner right and if you if you take let's say the middle of that range like what take about five dollars then you can see how you know to a lot of canadians and it's you know it can be affordable to send blockchain transactions for a lot of applications but if we're talking about like blockchains being this global thing that's supposed to you know empower people who are not empowered today um in underprivileged countries then you can see how it starts looking less viable right because we're talking about single transactions potentially taking up people's entire daily income and one of the things that you actually see um if you visit some of these places as we have right is that a lot of the time people do love blockchains they do love uh cryptocurrency i should say they love cryptocurrency but they don't love blockchains that's probably the way to put it right because what you actually see often enough is that people have cryptocurrency but they have it in binance wallets right like you even see you know entire ecosystem is where that just it's just accepted that everyone has a finance wallet and that and like sending from binance wallet to a mine and swallowed is the way that you make transactions right so why does this happen well obviously right if the blockchain is too expensive people are going to look for something else um that's like just a fact and it's a fact that we have to deal with and so if we want to actually wants to have a world where like we can have blockchain activity happening without needing to trust centralized exchanges for everything then we just have to learn how to make blockchains cheaper now today with rollups um it's uh already sometimes 25 cents sometimes less than 25 cents and if you just like analyze what's going to happen as a result of the improvements to roll ups that i mentioned in the future then we're talking about potential fees of maybe five cents or maybe even as low as 0.2 cents so massively cheaper uh transactions to the point where the out like unchanged transactions actually will become affordable for lots of people for whom they are not affordable today um bringing back crypto payments so this is uh an interesting idea right basically yeah for those who um who here has been in the crypto space since at least uh 2013 um who here has read the bitcoin white paper who here remembers the title of the bitcoin white paper um bitcoin a peer-to-peer electronic cash system right like you know back in the good old days people thought blockchains were for paying people so yeah right so you know even like back in this this picture um i'm curious does anyone recognize well which city and uh this is from it's not toronto um it is i believe this is actually berlin this is uh the bitcoin piece um basically it's uh the uh this is um there was an effort in uh 2013 um where uh people tried really hard to like get a lot of people to move to one place and to get a lot of restaurants like in the same region to all accept bitcoin at the same time and there was like this big social movement where people were really excited about like just trying to get an in-person bitcoin economy happening right and it started and it continued for some time but fast forward a few years later and people have mostly kind of stopped about talking about these things right and i think one of the reasons why is basically because blockchains for in-person payments so it just started stopped looking as attractive as it did before right and fees are just an obvious reason why right back in 2013 the uh one of the main arguments for why you should accept bitcoin was fees right the argument basically was like look paypal and the credit companies are very mean to us they charge at 29 cents plus 2.9 percent for transactions and they charge even more if it's international and so if you use if you send the payment with bitcoin well the transaction fees are one cent right and this was the argument and this was like the pitch by which uh the first wave of merchant adoption happened now since then that that argument has basically just become completely false now if blockchains can scale then guess what the argument becomes true again and so we're in a future where blockchains are cheap and we have even more network effects than we did before so the question is if we have much more scalable blockchains can we actually bring uh bring back crypto payments and i think it's something that's going to be worth trying right now crypto payments are something that exists in a lot of different ways right so there's crypto payments on the internet right you know lots of people use cryptocurrency for international payments already like it's just something that happens quietly and like people who do it you know they they just quiet and quietly do it but there's no reason for them to make a big marketing pitch and and uh announce it and and so it is happening but you know there are a lot of cases where more of it could be happening and it just isn't happening yet uh so there is but there but there's also kind of to merchant payments like paying for goods or businesses there is also um in-person payments right so in-person payments we tried to do and i think it may be worth trying to do again uh there are obviously micro payments there's many different kinds of payments right but this is uh the sort of thing that like today is a fairly niche thing but i think especially with blockchains being much more affordable it is something that could grow much more in the future um non-financial applications right so one of the big things about ethereum is like ethereum is not just a payment system right and there's supposed to be this like big um array of all of these other amazing things that you could use blockchains to do so um ens is probably the big one uh so who here has used a non-financial application on ethereum that's not ems who here has used dns right so ens is like by far the most popular uh non-financial application on the ethereum blockchain right and i think the reason why it's pretty clear it's just a really valuable and useful tool um and i think the interesting thing about ens is that it's like one piece of a puzzle that where there are a couple of other pieces that are very complementary to it that can help to like actually create basically like some kind of decentralized identity ecosystem on top of ethereum right so you have ens and ens gives you once you have a username without that username being tied to a company that controls it um account management right so let's say who here remembers pgp 1990s crypto wars everyone has their own you know public tea web of trust right there was this really big idealistic effort to try to kind of create this ecosystem where everyone would have their own cryptographic team and with these uh you know people would be able to sign messages they'd be able to encrypt messages we'd have privacy we would have security and like all without having to rely on intermediaries but the network effects never really never really happened it just sort of never really panned out well right now fast forward to today we have millions of people with uh crypto wallets and we have millions of people that have private keys inside their own browsers now why right well because they want to trade monkey pictures right so it's like you know 1990s you know you have these really kind of deep and philosophical arguments about like oh you know there's a there's this fundamental great battle between the authority of the nation state and the desire for individual freedom and if you want to protect privacy and if you want to assert your independence then you should then cryptography is the future of ensuring freedom of the humanity fast forward 20 years and it's like hey look it's a monkey and guess which one works better so now as a but like so this is like in my one of the kind of interesting double double edged swords of the crypto space right it's like the problem with the pre-crypto sort of idealistic decentralized tech movement is that it never had enough incentives the problem with the crypto space is that like it has great incentives but at the same time it has incentives that like go in very weird directions sometimes right so at the same time though like we have actually created this ecosystem where lots of people have cryptographic keys and we actually get the possibility of using these cryptographic keys for other applications and not just stuff on the blockchain so there's this project called sign in with ethereum where you can use your ethereum wallet as a way to sign into web services so if you go to chat.blogscan.com you know you actually see there's like a chat application it's basically like a telegram clone except you don't have to give up give your phone number to use it you just like use your phone you use your if you sign in with your ethereum account and you know like anyone who has an ethereum address basically already has a chat blockscan.com account um and you know if you know someone's ens day and you can go send them a message i mean you can send me a message i probably won't read it but you know you can send me a message um now so and i think um signed in with ethereum is like one of those things that kind of expects to start slowly growing more and more over time right um now one of the problems though is that if you just use cryptographic keys as your wallet as your account then like what happens if your key gets stolen what happens if you lose your key what happens if like any kind of accident happens now one of the kind of pitches that sometimes uh you know traditional web 2 companies argue about like you know why google should control your account and why it's good is because they can do account recovery right it's like if you lose your account or if something bad happens there's like people and you can appeal to those people and those people can give your accounts back now like my personal experience with this argument is that it's like somehow actually not true right like i've actually like i've personally talked to people who've had like trouble with their accounts with a lot of these web 2 services and they just like often they just can't get like get their problem fixed like they reach out to support reach out to support and they just like get stuck i mean like i personally a few months ago like i had my uh amazon accounts um you know flags you know like some suspicious activity thing because i dare travel between different countries um and then you know there's a form and like filled in the form and at some point they said okay well we filled in the form but we don't have enough information and like you know please hold on and like basically i i have not gotten my amazon account back right so web 2 companies are like you know they talk about how you know centralization is good because like you at least provides recovery but like somehow they've screwed this up so much that often they don't actually provide recovery so what can we do so what three can do this better right so for the last couple of years i've been talking about this concept of social recovery where like you can choose you know who your recovery contacts are right and like you can make whatever choices you want so you can say i'm going to have five recovery contacts two of them are going to be an institution one of them can be my employer one of them can be my dad one of them could be a friend and any three of those five uh can come together and uh recover your accounts and kind of reset your key to something else right and this is something that you can put into the rules on a smart contract put that on chain um so this is um you know it's a very simple approach um and it's uh i think a a sort of a model of security that is like both very decentralized right like you're not giving up your control to any one single person um and it relies on forms of trust that people have and that people are good at right like i think people and especially less technical normal people are going to be better at picking seven to seven friends that they trust and they are going to be like writing down 24 words and making sure they write down write it down correctly making sure this weird piece of paper is like they're going to be able to keep it for 10 years and not lose it or get it stolen ever but you know so it's like actually a great solution but implementing it correctly requires smart contract wallets so fortunately smart contract wallets are actually coming now interestingly enough smart contract wallets themselves so like actually being able to track like when these account recoveries happen when these key changes happen this itself requires a blockchain right so it's like instead of using your accounts to log in just or using your kind of off chain accounts to interact with stuff on the blockchain it's like no you're using your account which is on the blockchain to sign into services that can themselves also be centralized services that live on off-chain right so you can use the same account to sign into unchained stuff and often stuff so that's um the second piece of the puzzle third piece of the puzzle attestations right so uh you know it would be nice for example if you can prove that that your account actually is a human and that it's not a bot right so this is something that like for example in the context of social media a lot of people care about right so you know if you want to improve the quality of social media and like reduce the level of terrible stuff um without kind of you know trying to impose political like specific political opinions or like control in particular directions or whatever one very simple thing that you could do is just make sure that you know the people who are posting actually are people instead of being like some fake uh kind of farm where you have one person controlling five thousand accounts of the robot right but if you want to do this then like you have to be able to actually tell you know who the real humans are and who the bots are now fortunately on chain attestations um can actually help right so like if you use your ethereum account to sign into a service the service can actually go and inspect like first of all has this account ever sent a transaction right sending a transaction requires paying a transaction fee so just whether or not you send a transaction is like the simplest possible filter that makes it hard to create 10 000 fake accounts um just by making it really expensive step two um you can look at like things that that account has done you can check for a proof of humanity profile you can check for like a pope uh you know it's a a token that proves that you attended some particular event right there's like a lot of different things that you can check for and once you do that then you like you can get some kind of like better indication of like well how likely is it that this account actually is a unique person now this is something that we can improve over time so you can combine it with you know fancy zero knowledge stuff and we can improve privacy and you can do really fancy and cool stuff like proving you're a human without revealing which human you are right so we can have kind of privacy and uh better security at the same time now these are all different kind of pieces that really fit into each other right so you want to have an account in order to sign into services and interactive services now with that you want your accounts to have a name if you want to have a name ens is great for that if you have an account you want to be able to like manage that account be able to change the key do security stuff on chain smart contract wallets and you want to prove things about yourself um on chain attestations or off-chain at the stations could um kind of with proofs attached could work as well right so all of these pieces really fit together into this kind of ethereum identity ecosystem and like to me this is probably like the best candidate for sort of ethereum's second major app um aside from the the d5 ecosystem so that's not financial applications um dao's i think are also interesting right and dow's i think we've seen a lot of like big dallas but we can but we can also see a lot like we could see more microscale downs just like five or ten friends coming together for some amount of time and pooling a few thousand dollars together for some community activities so things that are kind of a little bit too simple to create an entire corporation around but where you still want to you know have the money be on chain and like have some out of to kind of make decisions together and have some transparency so all of these things could be done on chain right but making it viable and making people wants to do these things on chain requires the chain to be much more affordable um there's enterprise blockchain use cases as well right so people have been talking about enterprise blockchain use cases for years um and i think in this case like we don't actually need like fancy um you know roll ups and prototank charting for this there's a a structure called a volidium that people that have been looking into and building more and more basically it's like you do things in a server um and you do you kind of do execute things in a centralized way but then you use cryptographic proofs like cks and arcs and you publish them on chain and that way you have a regular record that basically proves that the changes that are happening are changes that actually are following the rules and because you're publishing on chain you can prove that you're not giving different evidence to different people and you can prove that the system isn't like reverting anything and it's not moving backwards right so these are this is also technology that is rapidly improving it's rapidly improved a lot over the last two years and especially i think with some of the zkvm stuff that's happening it's going to improve even further um so these are like some of the consequences that are going to happen from the technical improvements that are happening in ethereum over the next couple of years right but there are other technical improvements so the ethereum chain might in the future become not just cheaper but also faster instead of including your transaction after half a minute we might be able to provide confirmations after some shorter period of time what kinds of things will that make easier um what about improvements to privacy right well like what what can we do more of if ethereum becomes a more privacy preserving system what will better middleware unlock right so if people build applications are there applications that other applications can talk to where if you make one application good that itself opens space for even more applications i mean i don't know but i think these are all questions worth thinking about right so yeah this is uh this is basically what what i want what i hope that we can start thinking about more right the technical improvements are happening and they're going to happen but like what kinds of improvements in terms of what we use ethereum for um are these things going to make possible thank you

  - Video: "DEVCON1: Understanding the Ethereum Blockchain Protocol - Vitalik Buterin"
    hello ever'one welcome to the third day of the conference deep dive into aetherium protocols so we started off with Fei Jie wonderful presentation from Alex on the protocol on top of which the other aetherium protocols run so a Kaveri makes sense to follow that up with a presentation on the etherium protocol so you know the idea behind ethereum blockchain first came around back at the end of 2013 when people were getting really excited about Bitcoin people were getting starting to get excited about blockchain technology and applications beyond currency and there is a public consensus that watchings are useful for stuff and not just money so you know what change could be used for asset issuance crowdfunding domain registration title registration gambling prediction markets IOT you know people are coming up with some new category of applications every week and so you know the problem at the time is that most existing blockchain protocols were designed like this single purpose tools that are that are specifically designed around one particular application so in bitcoins case currency in name coins case domain registration in in prime coins case you know trying to do scientific computing and in my opinion not doing a very good job of it so then we had second generation protocols that works like this so we had protocols that had somewhere around 55 different transaction types where one transaction type is something like you know create a binary option another one is join a binary option and one for settling a binary option one for making a bet one for settling a bad one for doing some kind of two party dice game and every time someone came up with a new kind of application that was deemed important enough to be worth including the people who are creating these protocols would just add yet another transaction type so at the time you know we had protocols that are fifty-five transaction types I even worked for one of them for a few weeks after I worked one of them for a few weeks another two transaction types got added good old contracts for difference so even still you know it's pretty obvious I think from especially from the standpoint of our current generation of this particular way of doing things it's just fundamentally limited so what's the solution basically something like a smart phone so you know the idea is that instead of so instead of having you know a a protocol that's designed around one very small set of use cases you just create a general purpose operating system and you let people build whatever they want as applications on top of it so you know if you do that then things suddenly become better you know people maybe when you're inventing the protocol you might be thinking that okay people are going to use this for binary options contracts for difference making two party bets doing domain registrations and whatever other 50 applications you are aware of at the time then you know release the white paper and six weeks later you realize that people are inventing applications in a completely different direction and guess what your protocol does not even have to change one single bit in order to handle them so that's the power of generality so what is the classrooms behind a theorem well it's of watching CNN for six years pretty boring with a few tiny additions so the first important one is this concept of a built-in programming language so in aetherium there is a kind of a built-in Turing complete scripting scripting language it's essentially a hybrid between kind of standard virtual machine architecture is a bit Bitcoin script and and a few other things and the point is that you know people can write programs in this script or more realistically in high-level languages like that can pile down to the script then people to take their compiled scripts put them into transactions and send the transactions off to the blockchain transaction gets confirmed an address gets generated and you now have a special kind of account at that address called a contract so two types of accounts user accounts controlled by private keys you know we all the same old elliptic curve digital signature algorithm we all know and love second kind of account contracts controlled by code so these two types of accounts in aetherium essentially have completely equal privileges anything that humans have the right to do BOTS have the right to do so anyone can create an application with any rules by defining it as a contract so this is essentially the basic principle so you know the whole world of a theory am i creating a decentralized DNS system so basically you know the idea here is you want to create a system where people can register addresses and if they you know addresses could be you know something something dot eath and if they own an address they should be able to set the IP address associated with that ad domain address so the way the system works is fairly simple so you see a sort of declaration at the top data domains with an owner basically a mapping between a domain name and a to bowl containing an owner and an IP address and you have two functions one of them for registering a domain which basically says if this domain doesn't have an owner yet then sends the owner to or set the owner to whoever sense that particular transaction and you have another function set IP address which basically means if you own a domain then you set the IP address to whatever you want to set it to so you know fear varies simple rule set this is you know in of course you know real-life DNS systems have substantially more more features to them but sort of the fundamental core basically stays the same and you know you can probably build a more complex DNS system on top of this just by turning the IP address into a hash and throwing everything else on ipfs if you really want to but point it's very very simple logic you can write it in ten line in 10 lines of serpent code and publish it through the theory earlier here in blockchain and there you have a system that's basically like named coin so you know this is basically the meaning of you know anyone can create an application with any rules once once this application gets created then anyone can interact with the application by sending transactions that specify the contracts address as their destination address address so you send the transaction to a contract and that's how you talk to the application that's how you call functions that's how you do you know whatever it is that you want to do so in Bitcoin the state is fair is very simple it's basically just a mapping of in the sort of while technically speaking this sort of list of unspent transaction outputs but what it basically means in practice is it's the waste of balance as the west of sort of the amount of bitcoins that every particular person has and if you want to do a currency system that's basically all you need in aetherium the state is kind of more complex it's this sort of key value mapping going from addresses to account objects and there's two types of account objects one of them is the sort of simple accounts controlled by a private key in that case all you have is an onset of balance the second kind is accounts that are controlled by code and in that case you have these extra two fields that get filled up one of them is the code hash so the hash the hash of the code of that particular account and the second is the storage tree root which any sort of fairly intricate way that I'll describe later basically represents the kind of the entire set of storage of that particular account so for example if I create a contract with this code and register a domain then the fact that one protects domaine got registered to my and got registered with me being the owner and then they set the IP address to some particular value that information all goes into any sort of persistent storage of this particular account so basically no mapping from addresses to what blocks of this is the entire state of the etherium system at any particular time so code execution every transaction specifies a to address that it's sending to so you know this is fear fairly simple it's the kind of logic that we all understand if you set the message then you generally specify who you're sending it to and you want to specify the contents so what happens if you set a transaction to the to address well two options one of them is that the destination address is just a private key control account in that case all you're doing is moving ether around so if you do that then it's basically just being a cryptocurrency what if you're sending to an account that has code then what that's doing is that's basically activating the code and it's letting the code and it's actually letting the code run for set for some number of steps so code in aetherium gives you three things number one you can just send ether to other contracts number two you can read and write from the contracts own storage so for example if you're going here then the way that I would call the register function is by sending a transaction with data formatted in a particular way and with that function is going to do is or rather well that turns actually going to do is it's going to start running the code that actually represents the register method and we are it specifies self domains address donor equals m HDL sender that's setting a variable what that actually gets compiled to is setting a particular key in the contract so in storage so then the third thing code can do is you can call or basically sort of create these sort of virtual transactions that go to other contracts so theoretically you know I could create another contract that has some different set of rules and that contract itself can actually interact with this contracts that contract itself can register domains again an IP address of domains I could you know theoretically do just about anything that an account is controlled by an address can do so every full node on the blockchain processes every transaction in stores the entire state just like Bitcoin it's bold because it's important so this is sort of one of those one of those points that's important to make because you know people often ask well if I publish transactions to aetherium you know who is actually wrote well you know who so who is actually going to be enforcing the contract and who end and how many nodes are running them and so forth you know fourth year in 1.0 the answer is very simple every node in the network runs every transaction and that base in the process of running a transaction in you know if that transaction goes to a particular contract it actually involves executing contract code and you know setting and sort of changing the state to whatever the state is after the contract gets executed so firm that's the end point you can actually think of it as being a rather fairly simple system you know you can think of the state as being a database and you can think of each of these contracts as being as as being programs that are sitting on one computer except the computer is massively globally distributed it's actually a highly secure Network backed by tens of thousands of computers around the world so in school because it's important so gasps this is one of those sort of key mechanisms underlying the security of aetherium so when you tell people that you have a turing-complete programming language and that you let untrusted parties send code that's that's executed in a turing-complete programming language by every single computer in an entire network the first thing that they're going to ask is well what about the halting problem so there is this problem there is this very widely known result in computer science which basically says that it is mathematically impossible to create an algorithm which can tell whether or not any given program is just going to keep on running forever so how does the theorem prevent attackers from creating programs that just keep on running on everyone's computers forever and the answer is this concept of gasps so what this basically means that if your em network charges a fee for every computational step that that a contract execution takes so the specific way that that's implemented is that every block in the etherion blockchain has a gas limit so basically a limit on computational steps right now the gas limit is set to three one four one five nine two which is which is a nice number that we picked because we're totally not math geeks and so the then you know if you're creating a book if you are a miner and you're creating a block then chances are you're going to want to fill it with fill it with the transactions that give you the most profit so trend every transaction specifies a gas price basically an amount of ether that it's willing to pay per unit of gas and it specifies a maximum amount of gas that's willing to take so a transaction might specify I am paying 50 Chanin which is basically 50 billion from an ether per unit gas and I'm willing again and I'm going to consume up to five hundred thousand gas miners see all these transactions coming in they select the ones that have the highest gas price and they include them in their blog so when each transaction specifies to know that it's willing to spend up to two hundred thousand gas than what happen there is two things that could happen one of them is that execution takes up less than 200,000 good gas in which case everything happens normally it's okay the transaction pays only for the computational steps that it uses second case that goes over the limit if that happens then all the execution gets reverted and the reason why that has to be done is because if execution could stop halfway through then you might be able to sort of perform weird attacks on contracts so we try to like set together the execution to expire just at the time when like one half of the changes it gets me but the other half doesn't get made and you know we kind of preferred developers and be able to just not worry about that and so all the execution gets reverted but the transaction still has to pay for the gas anyway so don't run out of gas there's also gas isn't just a sort of simple 1/1 computational step one gas thing there are some operations for example operations that increase the amount of storage done that every node has to store and those operations take up a very large amounts of gas so the gas system is also the sort of fairly intricate set of incentives that are designed in order to encourage basic you using the resources of the FM system responsibly so gas limit is sort of the counter parts of the block size woman in Bitcoin how is the gas limits set very fairly simple voting mechanism right now if you mine a block then you can upvote or downvote the guest limit by a factor maximum factor of 1 over 1024 there is a default strategy in that we currently sort of instruct all the clients to follow in the source code which is you have a minimum of three one four one five nine two and if the usage starts bubbling up and hitting close to the gas limit then we target a one hundred and fifty percent of the long term exponential moving average of the gas usage so basically sort of targeted so that if it does get filled up the gas woman is going to be sort of just a bit higher than what then what one blocks normally contain so there are alternative strategies that we're exploring so one of them is this for example target a particular home go raid so what uncle's are Elbit explain a bit later but the general concept is that the more the blockchain gets clogged up then basically the more blocks and the slower blocks propagate and so the more blogs kind of get lost and don't end up being in the main chain and as it turns out thanks to a future of the etherion protocol you can actually calculate how much this is happening and so you can kind of target a particular amounts to which it's happening and you can say if we're seeing more than let's say 20 percent waste from blocks being just following off the network then the gas limit should go down so there are other strategies that work in centering so transactions contain basically seven sets of values number one nonce so what a nonce does is basically every every transaction has to have a union has to have a unique incrementing nonce so the first transaction you send from an account has to have a non zero second transaction you send has to have a nonce of one third a seven ounce of two and so forth and the reason this is done is to prevent real replay attacks so if Alice and ten eternal Bob you don't want Bob to take that transaction and reinsert it into the blockchain ten times the year himself another 100 ether now lets us fix that gas price the amount of ether per unit gas are we already covered that start gas same thing to the address of the the account that you're sending the transaction to or in other contract you're calling value the amount of ether that you're sending data is just a field of data the transaction sender can fill the data field with whatever you want says just an array of bytes no limits on length but the more there the more data a transaction includes there is actually a fee for that in gas so basically you lose 60 you have to pay an extra sixty eight gas for every byte of transaction data that you encode VRS there are values in an elliptic curve signature so look if you're familiar with cryptography you've probably heard of seeing the RDS the V value is basically an extra flag needed to do public key recovery so basically instead of checking the signature against the public key you actually derive the public key from the signature so there's this concept called of receipts so receipts are objects that kind of get hashed into the etherion block internet here and blockchain and every transaction has a corresponding receipt so these receipts have a few pieces of data one of them is an intermediate state route which once again will describe the mechanism later but it's a kind of hash that represents the entire state after the transaction gets executed number two accumulative gas tiers so the total amount of gas used in that particular block including that transaction so those first two things are kind of needed to do this sort of step-by-step accounting that what that actually makes it possible to kind of check what the validity of transit of individual transactions very easily and the third thing is logs so logs are this special feature in etherium that is sort of it's kind of a different kind of storage so in general you know when you set variables that gets set in account storage and that can be read or written by contracts logs are basically append-only so if you if you have a transaction in one particular block and it creates some logs those logs get hashed into that particular block but they are not visible but they cannot be accessed by contracts and they appear just in that block they're not in any kind of persistent state so nodes if they wants to for example they can just not store logs and it can prune and they can prune them so logs logs are also 10 times cheaper in terms of gas consumption and storage and the purpose of logs is to allow sort of efficient white client access to event records so one example of where you want to use a log is if you go back to the DNS example you might want to add a single line to create a log in the register method and in let's say the set IP method and the reason why you wants to do that is basically in order to allow white clients to very quickly scan through all the logs and sort of see all the instances at which so mean you know the domains got registered IP address got changed and so forth so there's lots of applications that wants to be able to sort of have a history of things that happen and logs are a convenient way of do of supporting that so logs have up to have a data field and they have up to four topics and there is a protocol that uses bloom filters to make it very easy for white clients to kind of search through logs so basically if you create a log that has a particular topic then you can very easily search through the entire blockchain and sort of identify all of the logs that's that matched a particular topic so if you're in virtual machine so once again as I mentioned it's this sort of combination of stack based architectures traditional virtual machines stat so inside of the virtual machine you have the stack basically you know 32 but 32 byte fields up to a maximum of 1024 of them memory just in it's an infinitely expanding byte array but the more you expand the byte array the more gas you have to pay so most of the limits in aetherium they aren't sort of static their economic and that's just a standard thing you're going to see again and again storage permanent contract storage you can read and write to good environment variables so for example the virtual machine you can access the block number the time the mining difficulty previous block hash and a whole bunch of other data so one one possible use case of that is let's say if you have a some kind of financial derivative that can only be processed or you know called struck or whatever after some particular time then you can you can say in the contract you can check the current the current block time stamp against you know some particular limit that you said logs so the virtual machine you can create these logs and there is an opcode by which the virtual machine in 10 itself call other contracts so this is basically the environment within which this contract code gets executed now you don't have to write in virtual machine bytecode yourself there's high-level languages so and one of these high-level languages is called serpent so this is this is one of them there's also one called there's one called salinity which is being you with being used much more right now there's one called lol which is kind of much more low-level if you wants to like really go into low-level code and be as efficient as possible you might want to here's lol although you know in my own opinion you you should probably consider serpents as well because servant lets you go as well as lol does and it has high level features as well so you know basically you write code in these languages then you have compilers and you can pile the contracts into bytecode and you can publish them you can publish the by a bytecode in a transaction going to the blockchain the ABI so when you send a transaction let's say that I wants to call the register method of that particular DNS contract that I keep on using as an example function calls get compiled into a transaction data so in this case the function call gets the way that it gets encoded is the for but the first four bytes are a function ID the next 32 bytes are the first start the first argument so this was the the domain that I wanted to change the IP address of and the second or the second argument ends another 32 bytes which is the IP address that you want to set it to so every time you call a function of a contract in ethereum it actually gets compiled into a transaction which is encoded in sum in using this algorithm which you know in simple cases looks like this just four bytes 32 bytes keep on going with 32 bytes but there are some special cases involving sort of variable length lists and so forth everything in aetherium relies on this one serialization algorithm called our LP recursive length prefix encoding so it's very simple so basically you know if you you know it's recursive length prefix encoding so you take the thing so in this case if you take the word dog and you just hex encoded you get six four six F six seven and you before it you prefect you prefix it with the length so in this case the length is three and yes you can see a three here over here you know it's an empty string and so you have a length of 0 over here this is a list and so it still has a length of 0 but it has a different sort of start flag because it's meant to be a list and not a string this is the four people who were set theory geeks this is a set theoretic representation of the number two it gets compiled to this or encoded to this rather if you have a string then you know gets compiled it gets you realized into this so there are like five implementations of this there is a much more detailed description on the weekly but basically this algorithm is used for blocks transactions network protocol order we sort of everything in aetherium land aetherium also has a cool new mining algorithm so the goal of this so listen is called eat hash so the purpose of this is to be GPU friendly and ASIC hard so it's a target GPU is as much as much as possible and basically prevent them from the problem in Bitcoin where you have these sort of spouts these specialized miners that with extremely large mining forms taking up huge percentages of the network so the algorithm is this uses memory hardness to accomplish this goal so basically instead of traditional proof-of-work algorithms like Bitcoin where the bottleneck is always how much computation you can do here the bottleneck is memory access and the theory behind this is that the more that memory is something which is highly optimized in which people spend billions of dollars optimizing it existing computers already and so the opportunity to make further up the optimizations is theoretically smaller than it is for computation so the way that it does this is by using this sort of we clever multi-level deck instruction so basically the idea is that you start off with a seed then from the sea to use this memory hard function create a cache then from the cache you create a data set and the data set can be created in parallel so each individual piece of the data set actually gets created by hashing together 256 parents that come from the cache and if you wants to just actually run the algorithm once then what you need to do is you take the data that you're mining on turn that into a seed then you grab a random 64 nodes from the pieces of the data set and you get your result so what's the point of this the point of this is that mining with this algorithm actually is memory hard because if he wants to mine and if he wants to mine at any reasonable speed at all then you basically have to pre generate this entire one gigabyte data set so that every time you pick a different non so you can just sort of sample from it and that happens fairly quickly if you just wants to verify blocks then you don't actually need the gigabyte all you need is a cache and the reason why is basically that if when you get to this stage you don't need to create this entire thing you just figure out what 64 indices you want then from each of those 64 indices are just computed from the cache now this does require you to make 16384 hash calculations but or as it turns out that's actually not that bad if you're only doing it once so because verification only needs to happen once this kind of low memory stole verification process actually works so but if he wants to mine then you need to do it with a lot of speed and so he needs to have the gigabyte so this is kind of the basic principle behind sort of why mining was in the particular way that it was in etherium so uncle's so in general Bitcoin has a ten-minute block time aetherium has a 17-second block time why is the block time not something even shorter like one second the problem with fast block times is basically stale rates due to network latency so if the block time is extremely long like ten minutes you can think of network latency as being negligible by comparison you can think of it as basically being instant and so we basically don't have problems once you start pushing block x down then your problem is that you have this risk that let's say over here we have one block in 2059 then at some point someone creates another block 2060 that block takes time to propagate through the network and so someone else might actually make another block before hearing about this block and so we have two blocks both on top of the same block 2059 and they're kind of both competing with each other so this is called a fork and the problem is that one of the blogs has to eventually win and the block that doesn't win just kind of gets discarded and the person who mined it doesn't get a reward so this leads the centralization risks so basically the issue is that the more powerful you are as a miner the better you are at getting a high network connectivity and if you created the last block then you don't have that you actually don't have this risk because you can just immediately start making the next block so because of the more these network connectivity issues become important the more problematic the centralization issues become and so you have this effect where large miners end up being more effective than smaller miners so our solution is this mechanism of on goals which is basically that if this happens then sure one of these one of these blocks is going to win but whichever whichever block loses it can kind of get Rhian cluded in the blockchain and it still receives most of the reward so the point of this as it basically cuts the centralization incentives by about 85 percent and it kind of allows the ethereum blockchain to continue to biess to be relatively safe under somewhat harsher circumstances both in terms of fast walk time and as of high transaction load Merkel tree is so how many people have seen the Economist cover from Blythe master saying it's all about the blockchain well my opinion is it's all about the Markel tree so and particularly unlike Blythe masters dogs I like it so which is more so the point of Merkel tree is is that there are this construction that allows for compact efficiently verifiable proofs that a particular transaction was included in a particular block so the general principle is that you know in G this is actually exists in Bitcoin if let's say every block has a few hundred transactions then if you wants to verify that one particular transaction was included in a block then you don't have to download the entire block you all you need to do instead is you can kind of download just one sort of branch of this tree and the tree is this kind of hash tree where every single sort of node in the tree is actually the hash of the two nodes below it and so we need to do is just download this kind of branch just download the specific part of the tree that's going down to your particular transaction and you check the hashes that are just going up the branch you don't check all the hash it's just the hashes that are all relevant to your particular branch and if all those hashes check out fine then you know that your transaction action that particular transaction actually is in that particular tree and so actually is in that particular block so the reason why this mechanism exists has basically for white clients so what a white client basically is as a clients that accesses a blockchain without processing every single block without downloading every single transaction why do you want this well it's pretty obvious you know the Bitcoin blockchain right now is thirty gigabyte is 30 gigabytes and you know a megabyte gets downloaded every 10 minutes it might be good enough for a high-powered laptop it's probably not good enough for this and it's probably you know in 30 gigabytes is probably too much for the devices that's the walk thought IT is going to be creating so instead you use these clever what you use these sort of clever tree protocols in to allow these devices to only verify the absolute minimum of information that they have to that's relevance to their particular transactions so in etherium the Merkel tree mechanism is actually some quite a lot more intricate than it is in Bitcoin so the idea with aetherium is that it's not just transactions that get stuck into morkul trees it's also the state so if you hear about this concept of a State Route what that basically is is this sort of is this root hash and from this root hash you have another tree and this tree goes and this tree goes down contains hashes of hashes of hashes of hashes of data representing the state of basically every single account in aetherium so you have use account objects as somewhere at the bottom of the tree you know you have nonce balance code hash and storage and storage is yet another tree so the point here is that you know if one of these like one of these white clients whether it's my phone or a select IT device or whatever else wants to know what the status of one particular contract is it doesn't have to process the entire blockchain it doesn't have to trust anyone all than it needs to do is just ask for a vertical proof ask for this sort of branch of the tree and verify just that one particular branch so this is basically the sort of concept of Ethier and white clients where a result from fulfill foldy is actually going to be presenting quite a bit more about this I believe after lunch today so every blog header actually contains three trees transactions State and receipts so it transactions are transactions we know what those are the state is every you know the entire state of every account balance storage every all the sort of static information that you need to know and receipts are they consist of this sort of extra auditing information and they have all the logs so if you're white client wants to know what what wants to know you know what particular logs or let's say associated with a particular topic then the white coin is going to ask for local proofs of logs so future directions we talked quite a bit about this on Monday but the general prints also the general categories are number one proof of steak so we're proof of steak is going to fit in is basically just at the top so it's just a change to the consensus algorithm so instead of blog instead of users having to verify to verify proof of work they're going to verify validator signatures instead and the way that you would join the validate validator set is you know as Vlad describes by submitting a secure a submitting a security bond so that entire mechanism is going to either be part of a protocol or it's going to be sort of specified in one particular contract not fully decided yet and from a user perspective all that's going to change is that instead of validating a proof-of-work nonce you're going to have a list of signatures that you validate instead skaila blockchain rent so the idea with watching rent is basically that right now you can access storage you can your code can set storage keys and those storage keys will remain there forever but potentially this might present very presentative serious long-term risks because the amount of storage could that the ethereum blockchain stores couldn't just keep on going up and up and there's not enough incentive in some people's views to remit so kind of to kind of delete storage there is a bit of an incentive because if you kind of delete store if you delete storage then you kind of get a refund but even still there's sort of no incentive not to kind of use storage as a bank so blockchain grant us the idea that every contract is going to have to pay some amounts per month for every storage key that it has so instead of storage being permanent you know one could imagine it lasting one year two years five years you know if this is going to happen it's going it's going to be as reasonable as possible but that's the kind of basic principle virtual machine upgrades so that's just going to not going to change any of the other semantics is you're going to swap out the virtual machine that the code runs in so in practice for developers is going to mean very little because theoretically you could still program in the same languages will just have a different compiler that can parse a different bytecode but if you wants to do things faster then you could potentially I mean ideally even program etherium code and things like C++ in Java scaleability talks about that on Monday so you know the idea that kind of having not every note process every transaction but I mean right now as far as the etherium protocol goes all this is basically it thank you

  - Video: "Vitalik Buterin - Ideas for things worth building"
    great thank you so today um i what i wanted to talk about is uh a bit of a and of the intersection between um some of the things that are happening in the ethereum space on a like very from a very technological point of view um so there's a lot of exciting things happening in ethereum technology with uh scaling privacy um a lot a lot of other different topics and just some ideas for what can happen on the what kinds of things i think it might make sense to start building on the application layer now we sometimes think of technology and applications as being separate but i think it's actually very important to think about them together because improvements to technology can make new kinds of applications possible right they can make applications possible by making them cheaper sometimes they can make applications possible by creating new tools by making it safer to use the ethereum blockchain which can make applications more accessible and so what what are we going to see from our technology in the next few years and what does this mean for what kinds of things it makes sense for people to really start building today um so i feel like we've at least on the internet and on the reddit and the twitter and the bankless and the youth global and all of these lovely forums talked about the merge a lot so i'm not going to talk about the merge um but i mean it will happen apparently it might even happen on mexican independence day which is yeah but so switch to pero steak great what comes after the switch to proof of stake right um so one probably the biggest thing aside from the switch to proof of stake that ethereum developers are focusing on today and really have been focusing on for a long time is scalability right so who remembers last year when it cost five dollars to send a transaction who enjoyed paying five dollars to send a transaction one person did i did not right so this is a problem right there's not enough space in the ethereum blockchain today for all of the applications that people want to make and this means that ethereum is too expensive for people and this is a problem and we have to fix the problem right so now if you look at the charts then you know sure today sending a transaction is maybe a few times cheaper than it was last year because last year was a bull market and now the bull market is kind of over uh not a bull market right now um so but you know markets are random right they can go in random directions and so we don't want to kind of rely on markets being in one place or another place for transactions to be cheap we just we want transactions to just always be cheap right and the only way to make transactions reliably cheap in the long term is to increase the amount of space um on the chain right increase the amount of space that uh transactions can use now in uh 2020 um we like i published this document called the rollup centric roadmap and at the time i think the ethereum ecosystem was really starting to move in that direction already right and the basic idea is to like split up the ethereum ecosystem into layer one and layer two where the job of layer one is to be decentralized to be safe to be open to be censorship resistance to be permissionless and to really focus on providing these things and to become more stable and even try to become simpler over time and it's the job of lawyer two protocols to add scalability on top right and that was two years ago and two years ago like roll ups were mostly test networks and ideas but fast forward to today and today there's a lot of scalability projects that are live now right so polygon is uh sponsoring this and i mean polygon in its current form right it is a side chain and so you do have to trust it but polygon is also do you know they've been doing all of this excellent work on uh zero attic zero knowledge proofs and so you know they are going to also have a gaziki roll up which is uh really amazing right now um also arbitrarium done movie continuing to move forward lots of great work optimism i i hear people from the optimism team might even be here um so you know stark like stark net zk sync just all of these projects that are just so much more mature than they were two years ago now this um scaling through roadmaps is something that has started and it's going to continue right so over here i have these two charts um this is uh so the first chart is uh roll up data space per block right so this is how much space there is and there is going to be in the ethereum blockchain for uh people for rollups to uh to use uh to put transaction data so today the amount is fairly low it's basically roll-ups have to compete with all of the other ethereum applications for space and so today i think the amount of roll-up data on chain is like maybe somewhere between 10 and 50 kilobytes maybe a few days more maybe some days or less i don't know the exact number but like it's not far from that um after the merge the next big focus of the client teams is likely to be uh what we call proto dank charting um which is also called eip4844 and this just adds a much larger amount of space for projects to uh or a much larger amount of data on chain the rollups can use to store transactions and after prototype sharding we go up to full dink shorting right and that's a typo this this is one megabyte this should be 16 megabytes right so a huge amount of space going up by a lot now in the meantime um also of some work happening kind of more quietly but still importance which is reducing the amount of space required for every transaction on the roll up right so this is just some data for an erc20 transfer so in uc20 transfer on the roll up today 180 bytes um a few months ago optimism added like this basic form of compression that we call zero byte compression knocks it down to one fit it's about 150. um signature aggregation you can knock it down to 128 um you need erc 4337 for that better compression 75 and like i mean totally amazing depression 23 right so on top of all of this extra space the amount of the amount of space that every transaction needs is slowly kind of in the process of becoming and is going to become nine times cheaper so the conclusion of again of all of these things put together right is that i think we have a lot of good reasons to believe that the ethereum blockchain will be like much cheaper like more than 100 times cheaper like it will be do it like building and doing things will be more than 100 times maybe even a thousand times cheaper than it was last year so the question for people building applications right is what i think there's two questions one question is how can you help the transition and the second question is if things are going to be a hundred or a thousand times cheaper what will you be able to build that you cannot build today right so i in in some of the presentations at the hackathon i already saw i think people are already having like exactly the right kind of thoughts in that direction right so for example a lot of applications focusing on like points of sale and in-person payments and in-person in-person payments or actually something like they're probably or just payments in general right they're the earliest application of a blockchain right so who here remembers who here read the bitcoin white paper but he remembers the title of the bitcoin white paper bitcoin a peer-to-peer electronic cash system right electronic cash use it to pay people for stuff now this is something that like earlier on i think a lot of people really believed and a lot of people really tried hard to do right um so like there's like these big efforts to try to convince a lot of like stores and restaurants in one particular place to all accept bitcoin there are projects trying to like convince a lot of online merchants to accept bitcoin and i mean with ethereum i think this kind of continued at the beginning but then sometime like over the last over the next few years transaction fees just became way too high and i feel like the ecosystem kind of quietly mostly gave up on that right and i think in fairness that kind of makes sense right because if you remember in 2013 one of the biggest arguments that people used for why like you as someone in a store or like online store or physical store should accept bitcoin is the fees right paypal charges 29 cents plus 2.9 and even more if it's international credit cards charge even more and here's cryptocurrent bitcoin one cent transaction fees right so it worked in 2013 but then in 2017 instead of the transaction fee being one cent it was 50 and so it did not work anymore right but with scaling like we are looking at transaction fees going back down to one cent and you know maybe even lower so maybe it actually and no today we're not in 2013 today we're in 2022 and the the size of the ethereum community the size of the crypto space um also you know bitcoin people doing i think uh some similar work with uh with the lightning network as well um the size of the space the amount of developers that are there to that that can actually like build really good and user-friendly solutions you can there's just so much more right so it i think it actually makes sense to try to like do try to do in person payments and online payments again um so that's just one example right but the the question that you should ask is like what other applications are not possible today or are not possible in 2021 but they are possible in a world where uh transactions are a hundred times cheaper so that's one thing that we can build that as a developer you can look at right the other thing you can look at as a developer is how might you participate in this transition right so in um here if you look at the chart closely like there's a couple of these very specific technologies that i mentioned right so erc4337 um i'll i'll talk about it a bit later but it's a basic uh account abstraction it's this uh kind of pro standard on top of ethereum that gives wallet designers a lot more freedom to choose like basically how well let's do their authentication so you don't have to have one key you can have multiple keys you can have different signature algorithms you can have recovery you can do a lot of things and one of the nice things that you can do with it is a signature aggregation right so you can take a large number of signatures combine them into one signature and you just save a huge amount of data right um so this is something that can like make a big difference but it's something that people have to actually do um and this so it's and it's something that people have to implement while it's for there are already a couple of teams um trying to build wallets that support erc 4337 but you can build more right and you can join those teams um and you know you can build your own it's um i think an area where just there's still a lot more room for people to participate better compression for roll-ups right so like what's the difference between like where we are now 154 bytes and and going down to 75 and even going down to 23. like if you're part of a roll-up team or you know he wants to contribute to a rollup this is one of those um things that actually could be very valuable to contribute um software for nodes in a world that has some of these scalability upgrades right so when in the ethereum blockchain has a lot more data when it becomes more stale scalable you users are going to need to have like better software for being able to access and process all of this data and this will not be something that the blockchain the ethereum node will be able to do by itself right so like this extra software has to be built and someone there are a lot of good projects that are building it but this is also some a place where there could be more right so this is uh the first category of um i think what how to think about what you can build right the scaling transition is happening and will and will continue to happen how can you help the transition and once we have the transition what kinds of things that you cannot cannot build today will you be able to build a couple of years in the future those are the things that it makes sense to start building today um zero knowledge proves so zero knowledge proofs are this uh very powerful technology that has become very big in the ethereum ecosystem over the last five years right basically it's a way to cryptographically prove that like some statement about some piece of data is correct without revealing the information about like why that statement is true so you can say like for example that i have an ethereum address and that ethereum address has a valid proof of humanity profile but you don't have to reveal which proof of humanity profile you have right so you can kind of like you can get have applications that increase security by kind of adding these uh guarantees into the application but at the same time preserve privacy now privacy is actually only one use case of zika starks right the other use case of zk snarks that somehow the exact same technology gives us is scalability and uh for scalability zika snarks are already being used in zika roll-ups today right so polygon polygon hermes and zk roll up yay um come on clap for the sponsor they're here okay um the right now they're not the only one right so zeke sync doing amazing work uh scroll doing amazing work the ethereum foundations team with barry whitehead also i'm doing amazing works dark net with cairo also doing amazing work but so a lot of work that's happening on zka for scalability and zk for privacy now in from the point of view of an application developer right so my perspective on this is that the zk for snarks for scalability stuff that's like mostly protocol level and mostly infrastructure level right so it will happen in zika roll ups and you don't actually needs to worry too much about it um but it just will make everything that you do more secure and cheaper zika snarks for privacy are a bit different right because like as an application designer you have to think about your application's privacy um situation right the privacy needs of every application are different and there isn't like a way to magically provide privacy for everything right like there is that there are some pretty like fundamental technical reasons why you can't so like basically you can't hide all the data from everyone because in order to make a transaction with the data you have to have the data right that's like the the easiest way to think about it and so for every application you have this question of like well who is going to have the data and how are you going to use these proofs and like who has the right to make what changes to the to the data you know how are you encrypting things how are you hashing things and all of this now some interesting examples of this um privacy preserving proof of humanity is like a very simple one right and some like if you want to create an application like one very um simple example of this might be that like let's say you want uh people to be able to like sign like you want to be um you have some um some conference and you want people to be able to like sign up and buy tickets for a con to that conference but you wants to limit your ticket purchases to one per person right so but at the same time you also don't want to like reveal everyone's information publicly on chain how do you do all of those things at the same time well you can you you can make a zero knowledge proof that says in order to buy a ticket you have to provide a proof and that proof proves that you have a proof of humanity profile and at the same time it reveals this kind of extra secret called a nullifier and if you make two proofs with the same profile they're going to have the same nullifier right and so if you just the nullifier by itself does not reveal anything but it still stops you from using the same profile more than once so this is something i mean i i actually have a post on my blog i wrote i wrote this a couple of months about like some very specific ways about how you use this technology but it is powerful right and if you're building an application you probably do have privacy needs and it's important to think about those privacy needs and ziki snarks are just a very powerful technology for dealing with privacy issues um sometimes there are there are privacy solutions that are kind of simpler and you don't need zika snarks um so um one thing that i mentioned publicly about a week ago is a stealth addresses right so if you want to send someone an nft and they have a public address like you don't have to send it to their public address directly you can generate a stealth address and you can generate an address that they control but nobody aside from them knows that they control that address um and so like this is it's a little bit more low-tech but it's also another way to like just not leak a little bit less information out to the public so everyone can see um so privacy um another really important um category of applications is the ethereum identity ecosystem and this is actually one of my answers to the question of uh like what can you build when ethereum is cheaper that you cannot be that you cannot build one if your aim is expensive right so i think like i i've become convinced that like aside from money and financial applications things to do with identity are probably the second biggest category of applications on ethereum right and uh i think the reason for this is uh is pretty clear right because uh ethereum and like blockchains by themselves in order to interact with them at all you need to already have an identity right so who here has a uh an ethereum wallet okay who here has a pgp key see not that many people right so this is like one this is one of these kind of double-edged swords of of blockchains and crypto right so back in the 1990s there were like a lot of people that had these like very idealistic ideas right that we have encryption now and we can protect privacy and we can communicate with each other and we don't need to have corporations and governments like snoop on everything now so the but and then they created all of this like amazing software and everyone could generate their own key anyone could send messages encrypted so other people's keys but it just never really went very far right like this is a group of developers but if i ask this at a non-technical ethereum conference i feel you know there would still be a lot of people raising hands for an ethereum wallet but probably almost no one raising their hands for a pgp key right why well pgp keys they're like a very difficult network effect to start right you have one application and no one else is using the application and so you're only really going to use it if your friends are using it already and it's just very difficult to get off the ground now you know you could of course argue like hey you know we believe in freedom we believe in privacy we believe you know we believe in like these wonderful ideologies um and like try to kind of convince people that way but in you know it didn't go very far now instead we have watch ins right and with blockchains we have money and we have incentives and we have um you know people wanting to trade like three million dollar monkeys and you know these now of you know there are big downsides to these but like one of the upsides is that people definitely have incentives right and so it just created it did create this incentive for even like very normal people like just uh people who are not interested like you know don't aren't kind of like very deeply involved like interested in kind of ideology and like freedom and privacy are just more like regular people that just um you know wants to save money um not lose their money to um you know hyperinflation uh be able to send money internationally just like do very simple things and um or you know just to like do the like do these things they have you know you have to create a wallet and once you have that wallet you can use that wallet for so many other things right so one of my dreams here is that we can kind of use this this as a path to improving how identity works on the internet in general right so like one of the problems with identity on the internet as it exists today is that it it's like very centralized right like you you sign in with google sign in with facebook and sign in with twitter and you just have like one company that controls your account they see everything that you do they can they can control everything that you do now and you don't actually get that much in exchange right so like one argument that people sometimes make is that like oh it's good that if that a company controls your account because well if you like if you accidentally screw up you accidentally lose your key you can call customer service and the company will help you get you get your accounts back this is actually often not true right like in reality like i've talked to lots of people who have lost their accounts and it's actually very hard to get your accounts back um so what if instead we could use ethereum accounts and we can use ethereum accounts to log into services so and even log into centralized web 2 services so instead of sign in with google we have signed in with ethereum so this is something that the ethereum foundation actually started like you know pushing uh kind of pretty hard last year again you know gave a grants to spruce um and a lot of other people in the ethereum ecosystem are really kind of pushing on this and there's more and more applications that are starting to just let you sign in with an ethereum account and you know especially if you wants to target like people you know the ethereum ecosystem and the cr the the crypto community it's very convenient now how do you recover your accounts right let's say you have an ethereum account and either your account gets stolen or you lose your account today we're not very good at this right now there are backups and there are seed phrases and all of these things but you know what happens if your account gets stolen right it does it doesn't really help um and sometimes um you know people are careless with their backups sometimes like really you know really bad things still happen sometimes people are lazy so one of the ideas that i've been like a big fan of for a long time is this idea of social recovery well that's right basically the idea is that like you as a user would choose some number of uh recovery contacts this could be institutions it could be family it could be friends it could you know you you choose who they are um some it could even be other wallets that you control um and if you choose some number of them then like let's say for example you choose seven recovery contacts you might need four of them or you might want five of them to be able to recover your accounts if you lose your account right now it's a it's actually you can even make it privacy preserving like you can make it so that you don't reveal to the chain who your recovery contacts are um and your recovery contacts don't even have to know who each other are right so it's like actually pretty pretty strong against collusion um so this could be done and it can it could work quite well um but in order to do this you have to have an account that is a smart contract wallet right so like you can't use a regular account you have to use a smart contract wallet now how can we make it easy to use a smart contract wallet to access your funds well erc 4337 right this is a kind of protocol that sits on top of ethereum that's designed to make it really easy to do this so what do we have now right you have you're in ethereum account which is an account and that is like an identity um if he wants to recover your account you can make it be a smart contract wallet um if he wants to use your account you can sign in with it um now if you have generally in the centralized world you have a username right and in ethereum we have a username we have ens um you can prove things about your account right so you can prove that like if you wants to prove that you are like some actual real accounts and that you're not a spammer there's a lot of things that you can prove you can prove that your account just sent at least one transaction on ethereum um you can prove that you have like some proof of humanity profile you can prove that you have a pope you can prove that you have like some minimum balance you can prove that you participated in some event you can even zero knowledge prove all of these things right so between all of these different applications together i actually think that look we have a pretty powerful identity layer already on ethereum and all that we really need to do is just build better versions of all of these different pieces on the stack and like start getting them to talk to each other more and like really start connecting things together much more and this is also something that i think as a builder um you can absolutely participate in right so that's uh a few you know a few a few examples of things that you can build there's lots of other things that i think are important so public goods funding is um important and uh you know i think there's a lot of good ideas around like making better quadratic funding applications um better ways to do credit assignments to like figure out exactly like all of the different participants that are responsible for making some public good happen so not just the person who claims credit at the end but kind of the entire tree that led up to them um there are better ways to to do governance for dao's um also important um better kind of meta applications like applications that other applications can talk to right so i think there's this big long list of things that are worth making but i also think that you know it's another thing that's important to realize here right is that like the technology is making it easier to build these things in a way that was not true two years ago right like two years ago we did not have scalability and you cannot you could not practically do any of this um two years ago zero knowledge proof technology was just not as good it was much you know it was much more difficult to use and so two years ago it was just much more difficult to build anything privacy preserving um two years ago we did not have like many parts of this stack and when you only have like one part of the stack it's very difficult to do other things but when you have like some version of all parts of the stack that it becomes much easier to build even better versions of any part of the stack right so technology is improving and i think it's possible for you know any of you to help participate in making the this effort of making the technology better and more secure and you know more reliable cheaper and more accessible but also really start thinking about well what kinds of new applications will all of this and new technology make possible
